        Hello Brad supporters! I won't go so far as to say that today's bearpits were a raging
        success, but all staff members agree that it went ten times better than last year's
        fiasco. In general the event seemed much more lighthearted and whimsical this year, and
        while we probably can't take all the credit for the change in attitude, we will anyway.
        Our immature tomfoolery has paved the way for similar silliness. Speaking of which, the
        spanking booth was a raging success, as my sore ass can attest. Maxon Thrasher certainly
        proved worthy of his name, giving me the worst beating of the day and breaking one of our
        hand-selected spankers in the process. My hat goes off to you. I was actually kind of
        shocked that more people didn't take us up on the offer to spank or be spanked by the
        candidate. I know that if I saw someone else with a spanking booth, I'd come a-runnin'.
        Maybe I'm just weird that way...<br>
        <br>
        Brad</font></small></p>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday is our day of rest before gearing up for the final leg of the
        campaign, just as God intended it. Saturday was busy with the free <a
        href="band/index.html">concert</a> on the lawn, some <a href="flipper_tag.html">Flipper
        Tag</a>, and a couple of <a href="band/index.html#hobo">evening cameos</a>. Sean ran into
        Erin Rae Lundy at COSA's wrasslin' show and she finally agreed to the date. It seems she
        thought we might make a production out of it, which is just silly. Stay tuned for pictures
        of the big night! <br>
        Cam Casey has been promoted to an official member of the <a href="staff.html">staff</a>,
        replacing Jared Dunsdon as an Advisor. His dedication to the cause and donation of time
        earned him personalized buttons and his very own bio. On this day of reflection I also
        need to thank Alex Wilson for providing the fanfare you hear each and every time the site
        opens. It puts the 'ass' in 'class'. And lets give it up for all the hard work <a
        href="hobo_night/Image018.jpg">Filip</a> is putting in on the website. Many people have
        contributed in small ways to the success of Reelect Brad, but I forget the little people
        so quickly. Sorry.<br>
        Our election poll has Brad with a slight lead at the midway point. We asked the staff and
        helpers who they'd vote for if the election was held today and Brad beat out <a
        href="hobo_night/Crafts%205.jpg">Mike Morain</a> 5-4. Things are looking good.<br>
        There is also a bit of a scandal and in the journalistic interest of full disclosure I
        must report that the rumors are true. It seems that Brad charged $2.38 for a Slushie drink
        and Zours candy to the campaign. This is a flagrant misuse of the allotted $50 funds
        limit. Way to blow it again, oaf.<br>

        Watching everyone play <a href="ring_toss/index.html">Ring-Around-Brad</a> filled us with
        that special kind of joy usually reserved for proud parents at a science fair.&nbsp; Many
        people won prizes (and there are still plenty more to go around so stop by), but most
        people gave Brad at least one decent thwack with an errant toss.&nbsp;That alone made this
        whole campaign worth it.&nbsp; Friday we will have all sorts of colorful supplies for you
        to make arts and crafts, plus free Donkey Punch! (You know you&#146;re curious&#133;) Then
        spend the evening bumming around with Brad at Hobo Night on the Commons lawn.&nbsp; Bring
        something (preferably edible) to toss into the giant pot of hobo stew and tell sob stories
        around the ol&#146; fire barrel at smoker&#146;s corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p><font face="Arial">Thanks to everyone who entered yesterday&#146;s &#147;Win a Date
        With Brad&#148; contest. I was truly amazed at the turnout. Where are all of you when
        I&#146;m not running for office? Unfortunately, there can only be one (cough, cough) Grand
        Prize winner, but we do have some nifty crap for the two runners up. Speaking of which,
        here are the results of our totally random (I swear) drawing. Bringing up the rear in
        fourth place, and winner of a lovely Brad poster is Associate Campus Minister, Shandra
        Newcom-Wolsey. Coming in third, and taking home a stunning official Brad campaign button
        is none other than our arch-nemesis, Michael Morain. In second place, earning a lovely
        prize package consisting of a Brad poster, trading card, and keychain is Kurt Thrutchley.
        And now, try and calm down, I know the tension is amazing but please don&#146;t go all
        freaky. The official Grand Prize Winner of the amazing night out with myself: (drum
        roll)&#133;.Erin Rae Lundy! (Cymbal splash!) Congratulations you lucky girl, I&#146;ll

        that if you are offended by anything you see here, it is your own damn fault for being

        been warned. To the rest of ya&#146;ll, thanks for your interest in my campaign, hopefully
        this year I can sucker more than 14% of you into voting for me. For everyone who&#146;s
        curious, there will be <i>no</i> posters this year, except for the one in the MSC, which
        is boring. We&#146;re trying to do something different this year, so this campaign is much
        more event-oriented. Please check out the <a href="calendar.html">calendar of events</a>,
        for a complete list of all our immature shenanigans, and be sure to stop by our daily
        booth-o-fun located in the MSC mainroom. I hope you&#146;ll enjoy this year as much as
