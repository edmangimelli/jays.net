Successful Internet Commerce: One Flourishing Model  
Jay Hanna, President, Global Shopping Club, Inc.  
As Internet commerce and the Internet in general continue to expand,
many businesses find their efforts to harness the power of this new
medium frustrated by unrealistic expectations and unprofitable loss of
corporate focus. This presentation details the ways in which Global
Shopping Club Inc. has gathered, interpreted, and implemented new
technology as it has become available in order to pioneer a powerful new
distribution channel for retail and liquidation product. Careful extrapolation
of this model will help to establish a set of generalized guidelines to help
businesses decide how and when to exploit (or avoid) the Internet to
further primary corporate objectives.
