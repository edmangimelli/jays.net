Most people don't give much consideration to donuts. They're a
tasty little crème/cherry/marshmallow filled and/or
chocolate/vanilla/caramel frosted breakfast pastry, good with some
coffee or milk early in the morning to start your day with the
recommended USDA of sugar. However, there is a whole life behind
breakfast pastries that the early morning commuter does not see.
Behind closed doors at Dunkin' Donuts, some poor bastard has to
create these succulent delicacies in the wee small hours before
the road construction crews and traffic police arrive to eat their
daily fill. I however, have seen the horror of donut-makery first
hand, for I was once that poor bastard.
<p>

My hometown was the nesting place of a quaint little 24 hour
donut, coffee, sub, and video rental shop called Bakery Buddy. It
was a happy little mom & pop operation that had not yet been
steamrolled into extinction by sterile, faceless, Starbucks-esque
mega-corporations. As a high-schooler, I used to go there quite
frequently, as it was one of about 3 places in town you could go
at 4 a.m. One summer, the BB was advertising an opening in the
overnight shift. The pay was pretty good for a fast food type job,
and I had no pressing need to sleep while it was dark out, so I
decided to give it a whirl. I figured it would be better to learn
while I was still young whether or not I had the fortitude to work
overnight shifts. Surprisingly, (to me) I was given the job almost
on the spot. I would later surmise that I must have been the only
person stupid enough to want the job, and that the person I was
replacing had either died of exhaustion and/or despair, or perhaps
gnawed his leg off and beaten the manager with it to escape.
<p>

Of my first (and only) eight hour shift at the Bakery Buddy, seven
and a half of those were spent glazing, filling, or frosting
donuts. In retrospect, it should have been obvious to me that in
order for donuts to be fresh at 5:30, they have to be made by the
poor schmuck who works at 4:00, but I was not terribly bright at
that time of my life and expected to do little other than work the
counter and watch movies on the in-house VCR. Making donuts gets
boring after about 5, so by the time I was sick of the job, I only
had about 995 donuts left to make. It was going to be a long
night.
<p>

Chocolate and caramel frosted donuts are made by throwing the
unfrosted pastry down into the vat of semi-melted frosting, then
retrieving it (with your bare hands) before in sinks too far down
into the sticky morass. Imagine your kitchen sink full of thick,
gooey fudge, which you must stir almost constantly with a giant
spoon to keep it from developing a layer of skin on top (while
saying double, double, toil and trouble and cackling like an old
crone for comedic effect). Now, large quantities of chocolate
(especially heated) has a certain smell to it that is pleasant for
about 10 minutes, then becomes a choking miasma for the remainder
of the night. The inside of a fudge shop x50 is about the stench
I'm trying to convey here.
<p>

Glazed donuts are by far the nastiest to make. While you can make
frosted ones while getting only a minimal amount of caramely goo
on your hands, glazed donuts have to be completely submerged. The
glazing trough resembles a giant paint tray, with a deep end on
one side and a draining rack on the other. Have you ever sneezed
onto your hand, and noticed how the snot will sling to your
fingers in little ropy strands? That's what glazing does as well,
but it's all over your hand and a little way up your arm as well.
It also has left-over chinks of yicky crap that falls off the
donuts such as coconut, sprinkles, and little bits of dough. If
feels about as good as cleaning the gunk out of a pumpkin, only
more sticky. I think my old wristwatch is still in that stuff
somewhere.
<p>

My dedication to the pastry arts was not strong enough to keep me
at that job. I finished my first shift and told them that I would
not be coming back for a second. They said that it was ok, and the
a lot of people quit even before their first night is finished, so
I didn't feel quite so bad then. The Bakery Buddy has since
closed, probably due to numerous health code violations involving
people's arms in the garnishings, and been replaced by a fast food
Taiwanese restaurant (which looks pretty darn silly since the sign
is still a chubby Italian guy in a chef hat).
<p>

I chalked up that job to "life experience" since I was never paid
for my eight hours of disgusting torture, and went on to seek
greener pastures. However, I still cringe whenever I see a Krispy
Kreme, and only eat Hostess' mini donettes, which are untouched by
human hands.
