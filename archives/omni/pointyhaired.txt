Hiya Paul --

I'm busily shifting *everything* technical that Jay has been doing (total 
work load 55-80 hours a week, next-to-no vacation) into the control of 
members of my department. My goal is that within a couple of weeks I will 
be the lead developer/contact of/for *nothing* technical from here on out. 
Once achieved, I will then be managing/mentoring/very-high-level-organizing 
full time, hopefully freeing time for me to additionally be a sporadic 
coder working "under" another programmer's project control for brief (?) 
spurts of assistance.

In my 6+ year career as lead computer mojo'er, I've never attempted an 
arrangement like this. Actively suppressing my intense knee-jerk 
volunteerism ("hmm... If I stayed really late tonight I could get that 
done...") I'll be holding my staff ultimately responsible for *everything*. 
I will, of course, maintain high departmental morale at all times, 
reinforcing them each and every time they need help.

Many things won't get done instantly, as they have been, but my hope is 
that overall everyone will be pleased with the results. I might even "get a 
life," which everyone from you to my mother have been telling me to do for 
years. Wish me luck. -grin-

As always, I'm wide open to your feedback.

P.S. Can I get a copy of my review?

Thanks,

Jay Hannah
