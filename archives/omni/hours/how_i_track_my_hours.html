How Jay tracks his hours.
<ol>
<li>I track every working minute of every day in <a href="http://www.formassembly.com/time-tracker/">Time Tracker</a> (free).
<li>At the end of each day I type the totals per line item into <a href="http://freshbooks.com">FreshBooks</a> (free).
<li>At the end of each week I...
  <ol>
  <li>Export my hours (for all time) from FreshBooks to a CSV file, and scp that file to my Linux server (<a href="hours.txt">hours.txt</a>).
  <li>I run a program I wrote (<a href="load_pl.txt">load.pl</a>) which loads that CSV file into a SQLite database.
  <li>I run a program I wrote (<a href="hours_pl.txt">hours.pl</a>) which reads the SQLite database and creates HTML reports for my various bosses. -grin-
  <li>For Omni I manually summarize that <a href="omni.html">detailed report</a> into a simplified <a href="omni_payroll.txt">payroll report</a> so Sean doesn't spend an hour every week recording my hours.
  <li>I email Sean a link to my payroll report. (It includes a link to the detailed report, for his review.)
  <li>(I occasionally commit hours.txt file to my SVN repository, as a backup.)
  </ol>
</ol>

This whole process (for Omni) takes about 3m a day, and an additional 6m at the end of each week. (UNO has additional paperwork I have to do.)
