So if I was to pull up Kristine's "OLD" report from yesterday and compare 
it with Syndey's "NEW" report from today, would it match the "OLD" -> "NEW" 
block for next Monday?

Hi Kirstine,
The only modifications that I made to the rate change report were what was 
specified by you and Sydney at our meeting.  These changes were adding the 
valid days column, sorting the report by hotel and date, and adding a 
warning flag for when valid days change.
Pam had some concern about the report.  She was under the impression that 
the report was only showing "NEW"  and not "OLD".  The report does show 
"OLD", however you specified that you wanted only one days changes on the 
report, so if for example I made a change to a rate yesterday and then made 
a change to the same rate today, the report would only show a "NEW" because 
the "OLD"  is outside the specified one day window for the report.  If you 
made a change to a given rate today, and then made another change to the 
same rate today, the report would show both a "OLD" and a "NEW" for that 
rate.  This is the only difference between the report you get, and what 
Sydney gets (The same program generates both reports).  On Sydney's report 
if a change is made to a rate today, she will see a "NEW" for todays change 
and a "OLD" for what the rate was prior to the change, regardless of what 
date the "OLD" was created/updated.  If you, or Pam need to see more of the 
"OLD" info, I can start sending you Sydney's report, as well as the one you 
currently have.

                                                        
                                                                        Thanks

                                                                                Val.
