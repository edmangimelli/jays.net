==Passing messages between sessions==

 13:51 <+integral> POE has a mechanism for passing messages between sessions, would
                   that help?
 14:14 <@dngor> magnet_: post() and alias_set()
 14:14 <@dngor> perldoc POE::Kernel

==POE::Filter::Line==

 13:05 < jhannah> sanity check:   I'm receiving a stream of XML blocks via TCP.
                  Between each XML block is the ASCII 00 character (\x00). In
                  POE-land I'm thinking I should define a POE::Filter::Line with an
                  \x00 delim, and everything's golden?
 13:06 <@dngor> sounds good to me
 13:06  * jhannah jumps for joy, giddy with excitement
 13:06 <@dngor> The only potential insanity: If the last block isn't terminated by
                \0 it won't be returned by the filter.
 13:07 <@dngor> May be significant if the \0 is a separator rather than a terminator.
 14:18 < jhannah> dngor: Thank you. I consider \x00 a record terminator, so if the
                  sender doesn't send \x00 and disconnects, then shame on them and
                  their last message is not processed.
 14:42 < jhannah> laugh.... actually my XML payload is in the middle, here:
                  /^\x02(.*?)\x03/ ... I'm not sure POE::Filter::Line handles
                  this...  :)
