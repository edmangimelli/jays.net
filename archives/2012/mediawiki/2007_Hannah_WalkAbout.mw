==Questions / Misc==

* What's the glasses/contacts idea during scuba? Without either I won't see any cute little fishies. Or monstrously hideous sharks eating my legs. Can I wear contacts inside a scuba mask? --[[User:Jhannah|Jhannah]] 13:08, 17 May 2007 (UTC)
** Mom and I are doing disposable contacts. We'll see how it goes. :) --[[User:Jhannah|Jhannah]] 15:18, 22 May 2007 (UTC)

* Matt Honaker's dad was telling me about Australian opal mines where the entire town ended up underground since it was so much cooler there. In a 5m Google search I found [http://www.umoonaopalmine.com.au/ Umoona Opal Mine], but its way the heck and gone far away from where we'll be. I wonder if there are any closer. --[[User:Jhannah|Jhannah]] 16:26, 21 May 2007 (UTC)

It will be cool in Sydney (winter starts on 1 June), tropical at Heron Island and cold in Melbourne.  We have the same problem packing for France and then Ireland. Fortunately, everything is green and lush as we have had some good rainfalls lately.  Most of the country is in severe drought, the worst on record."

There are thousands of registered clubs in Australia, meaning they are private for members and guests.  As travellers you are most welcome in any of them and all you need to do is register at the entrance to go in.  The Iceberg’s sits on a cliff overlooking Bondi Beach and directly below is a swimming pool that the members fill with ice each year for their annual iceberg swim.  The bar and restaurant below have one of the greatest iconic views of Australia."

The King George IV hotel (all pubs in Australia are referred to as “hotels”) has its own micro brewery.  It has recently been taken over by some youthful owners who are making an effort to keep it running, worth a try as Picton is only a small village (many people who live there commute to Sydney to work)."
