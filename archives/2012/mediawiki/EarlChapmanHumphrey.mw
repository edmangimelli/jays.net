==Oral History==

In April of 1990 my father [http://jays.net/genealogy/Html/I1076.html James Bradley Hannah] recorded an oral history with my grandfather Earl C. Humphrey on 4 90 minute audio cassettes. In April of 2008 (18 years later) I digitized the audio cassettes and started this project, a transcript of that audio history.
