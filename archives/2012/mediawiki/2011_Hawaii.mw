There are a bunch of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands islands in Hawaii,] I’ve only been to Kauai, Maui and Oahu.

'''Maui:''' We’ve stayed on Napili twice, Kaanapali Beach once. Great place to go for a first trip.  This is busier and you might find more to do on this island.  The Hana road is a must-do drive and so is Haleakala.  If Sara and I go back again we’ll hit Maui. Kaanapali has a long path along the beach that connects a bunch of shopping and hotels.

    Napili the most affordable?

'''Kauai:''' We’ve stayed on Poipu Beach a bunch. This island is quiet and has the rainiest spot on earth.  They filmed several movies on this island including King Kong.   There are a few touristy beaches but you can find some very secluded ones since the island is less busy.  If you want more peace and quiet go here.

    [http://www.vrbo.com/178792 A beautiful 4 bedroom house for $1100/week?]

'''Oahu:''' I’ve only stayed here once, and it’s super busy.  Pearl Harbor (Arizona), Hanauma (sp?) Bay and the North Shore are good places to go.  

'''Molokai:''' If you want super seclusion try this island.  It’s an old Leper colony that has some hotels on it.   I’ve never been here but it looks interesting.

'''Big Island:''' This island is huge and the most rugged.  You might like it, I want to go some day.

Regardless, if we went again we’d find a place from http://www.vrbo.com.   You can find some private condos in resorts that are better than the condos that the resort offers to the public.
