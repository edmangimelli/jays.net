* Dhundy R. Bastola (Kiran)- Same as Brian, I was introduced to the “Power of Perl” by Bob Fulkerson. Not a professional programmer but molecular biologists by training. Just like restriction enzymes (protein), Perl is an indispensable tool in my laboratory.
** I strongly believe DNA is a source of biological information. Just like information can be communicated using different languages, I believe the information stored in DNA is extracted and communicated in different languages. However, the choice of language depends on the type of cells the DNA come from. I am in a quest to extract information stored in DNA. I have found Perl to be an important tool for this purpose in helping many biologist like me.

* [[Jay's Perl bio circa 2003|Jay Hannah]] – Just another Perl hacker, Perl was Jay's first "real" programming language back in 1993. He's been using it ever since. He's also the Omaha Perl Mongers defacto group leader and a Perl Mongers (international) admin volunteer.

* Andy Lester
** Andy lives in McHenry, IL, and is active in the Chicago Perl Mongers, but hangs out on the Omaha.pm mailing list.  Plus, he's lived in Lincoln and Milford in the past, so that should count for something.

* Scott L. Miller – Professional Network Architect/Engineer.
** I design and implement highly available, fault tolerant networks. Writing Perl scripts helps me locate and stay on top of any networking issues.
*** ''Networking to me has nothing to do with any Operating System, it means Switches and Routers; – and Layer 3 Switching is just a form of routing''
** I used to be a professional programmer, and have had experience/significant exposure to many different languages.
** I'm a [http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=274556 monk] on [http://www.perlmonks.org/ Perl Monks] as of early 2005, and I have contributed a small patch to the core Perl distribution.

* Brendon Smith – I am a new member new to perl but not CFML,.ASP,SQL,MS SQL,PHP,Action Script etc. I am the Web Developer @ the [http://www.csm.edu/ College of Saint Mary]. You can also find my personal website @ [http://www.seacloud9.org/ SeaCloud9] I like to soak up knowledge.

* [[Brian Wiese]] – pretty much a perl newbie but I've got the awesome white-Camel on black tshirt, so I'm an official perl geek! (monger?) I was introduced to perl in [http://morpo.com/robert Bob Fulkerson]'s infamous [http://www.morpo.com/robert/index.php?page=uno CSCI 2850] '''Programming on the Internet''' course at [http://www.unomaha.edu/ UNO]
* [[Christopher Cashell]] - I'm a System Administrator/Engineer type guy who does a decent amount of coding to assist me in my work.  Most commonly that involves log processing and automation, but I whip out the Perl Swiss Army Chainsaw pretty regularly for other miscellaneous things, too.  I've got some experience across a bunch of different programming languages, but nothing else provides the power and flexibility of Perl.

* Add yourself here! Or alphabetize the list, or whatever...
