__NOTOC__
Welcome! Omaha.pm is the Omaha, Nebraska, USA Perl users group.

[http://www.perl.org Perl] is a computer programming language popular for a wide variety of tasks. [http://omaha.pm.org Perl Mongers] are programmers/dabblers of all skill levels interested in learning more about programming Perl, programming other languages, and general computer geekiness.

Join our mailing list and come to our meetings! We welcome new members of all skill levels. New to computer programming and motivated to learn? You're in luck! Perl is free, and so are our meetings, mailing list, etc.

Chat with us in IRC!

 Re-live those memories! -grin-

==Meetings==
We organize Perl-specific meetings whenever anyone requests that we do so on the mailing list.

Every month we crash the [http://odlug.org Omaha Dynamic Language Users Group] meetings and sneak Perl into every solution. :)

Peruse and add yourself to the [[ODynUG|presentation wish/volunteer list]]. Check out out [[meeting history]].
