:''The [[Omaha Dynamic Language Users Group]] and the [[Omaha Perl Mongers]] are proud to present the first-ever Catalyst web development workshop in Omaha, Nebraska.''

'''[http://catalyst.perl.org Catalyst,]''' the elegant MVC framework, will make web development something you had never expected it to be: Fun, rewarding and quick.  

When? Where?

{{stop|line1=You missed it!|line2=This workshop was held on Dec. 14 2009. Email the [[Omaha Perl Mongers]] mailing list if you'd like us to schedule another workshop.}}

Are you comfortable ssh'ing to a Linux box, issuing a few commands and editing a few files? Then don't just attend the workshop, '''participate!'''

Registration is free, but required in advance to participate. To register, join and email the [http://groups.google.com/group/odynug ODYNUG mailing list,] or join and email the [http://www.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/omaha-pm OPM mailing list,] or email <code>jay(at)jays(dot)net</code>. Send your first name, last name, and email address. We'll create an account on <code>clab.ist.unomaha.edu</code> for you and email you your password, which you can change to whatever you like. We have 30 PCs and wired and wireless Internet access, so you can work from a PC or bring your own laptop. 

Not comfortable ssh'ing to Linux? By all means, still attend. You can watch Jay run through the entire workshop on the projector.

Are you dying for a sneak peak of the details in advance? By all means, proceed to [[Catalyst Workshop: The Exercise]]
