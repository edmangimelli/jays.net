        out a schedule that will allow him to graduate in four years. Sean has an immaculate
        fashion sense, wearing Air-Force flight suits, flip flops, and garish sweaters purchased
        at Goodwill on most days. His musical tastes include jazz, classical, and independent
        punk-rock. Looking through his record collection is like reading a book entitled &#147;101
        Bands You&#146;ve Never Heard Of&#148;. Sean&#146;s hobbies include soccer, skateboarding,
        and making fun of Paco.</font></span></td>

        Schipper&#146;s importance to the Brad Campaign cannot be understated. Without his undying

        during those long nights of brainstorming. He may also contribute to the idea process
        some, but we really can&#146;t remember for sure. Matthew is not only the founder, but
        also the world&#146;s only practitioner of the Half-Assed Fancy art movement. Most of the
        time his unconscious form can be seen lying on the couch, but during those few waking
        hours, Matthew enjoys a wide variety of diversions from napping to thinking about
        sleeping. He is also a varsity track runner (in theory) but can&#146;t seem to pass PFM.<o:p></o:p></small></font></td>

        basketball player, and holds the Stewart Manor C-league point record for a single game. He
        is also the singer and writer of the popular (around here anyway) song &#147;Donkey
