Throw a kick ass bike (the Schwinn S-20) into the back of the 
world's coolest sport truck (Dodge Dakota), and you've got yourself a 
Colorado downhill paradise. 
<i><a href="/sounds/behave.wav">Ya, baby!</a></i>
<p>
Of course I've never been to Colorado for downhill, but whos counting?
Oh, and my Dakota is an SLT package, so there's more chrome on the front. 
And there's a bed liner and Hollywood bar (bike rack) mounted in the back 
of mine. And my truck has never been <i>that</i> clean...
<p>
I know nothing about the 
<a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/jtenn3101/opbc.html">Omaha Pedalers
Bicycle Club</a>, but probably should. I live 200 yards from the Keystone
Trail, and 1/4 mile from the junction of the Keystone and the Big Papio
trails. There are quite a few <a href="/images/omahatrails.jpg">bike trails
in Omaha</a>.
There's plans to run the 
<a href="http://ngp.ngpc.state.ne.us/infoeduc/cowboy.html">Cowboy Trail</a>
this summer.  The
<a href="wabash.html">Wabash Trace Trail</a> goes from Council Bluffs
into Missouri somewhere
-- double track converted trail with single track technical on either side. 
Watch out for hosses. They're big.

   <td>Around Cunnignham w/ Eli. We were going to go twice but I started 
   chain sucking and we were both tired-ish and I needed to mow before the 
   show, so we just went and at Chinese instead <i>-laugh-</i>. 
   Thanks Mi Un!.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2000-04-22</td><td>14.8</td>
   <td>From my house around Lake Cunningham and back - you definatly want 
   your nobbies on this one!</td></tr>
<tr><td>2000-04-15</td><td>11.0</td>
   <td>Due east to 46th street or so. Hilly as all get out -- coast, burn, 
   coast, burn, coast...</td></tr> 
<tr><td>2000-04-01</td><td>24.5</td>
   <td>From the house down to the softball field across from my old apartment
   and back. Stopped at the half-way point and almost froze. Funny how your
   hands aren't cold if you're pedaling hard...</td></tr> 
<tr><td>2000-03-05</td><td>14.0</td>
   <td>Quick trip east w/ Eli. Never been east of my house before. Not much
   out there.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-11-05</td><td>20.0</td>
   <td>Got my bottom bracket greased and tightened - the bike's back
   in shape. 20 degrees over average high drew me out for the first
   time in a long time. Slacker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-9-21</td><td>15.3</td>
   <td>Quick road trip down Keystone and back. Burning off frustrations. 
   Catharsis method, don't fail me now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-9-18</td><td>10.8</td>
   <td>Lazy biking on Wabash w/ Eli.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-9-6</td><td>10.2</td>
   <td>1 1/2 circuits of Lake Zerinsky. The first circuit went great
   -- 16.1 miles an hour average up and down hills, tight corners and all.
   The second circuit was interrupted by insane swarming 
   rabbits that get caught in bicycle headlights and jump <i>straight
   up</i>. Vewy weird and vewy waskely. Had to slam my brakes for one of 
   'em and slipped my back brake line somehow.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-8-29</td><td>29.4</td>
   <td>Down the Keystone to the "Papio Plant" (power plant, I assume). 
   Road tires are amazing! Super-quick compared to those nobbies on cement.
   Almost hit a couple midnight fisherman down on the levee. Thought they
   were cows or something in the dark, cloud-covered, moonless night...
   </td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-8-14</td><td>29.2</td>
   <td>The Wabash Trace down to Silver City w/ Eli. OOoooo... that's almost
   a tan I've got there. -grin-
   </td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-8-9</td><td>14.8</td>
   <td>The Council Bluffs trails. Semi-offroading in some *serious* slop.
   </td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-8-1</td><td>23.1</td>
   <td>Up to the end of the Big Papio and then down a mile past
   what used to be the southern end of the Keystone. Looks like 
   they extended the heck out of it this summer. A word of advice:
   don't go road biking with knobbies. They work *great* on
   the sidetrack of the Wabash, but
   I could hear half my energy whirring off on the trail this whole trip.

<tr><td>1999-7-26</td><td>14</td>
   <td>Just a little Wabash. 101 degrees out. <i>-sweat-</i></td></tr>

   <td>Keystone trail up to my new house and back w/ Eli.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1999-5-25</td><td>19.8</td>
   <td>On the Keystone to Fort and back in total darkness. That light kit
   sure does come in handy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-5-17</td><td>28.2</td>
   <td>On the Wabash with Tom Bertino (w/ the Omaha Community Playhouse)
   down to Silver City and back. I forgot my headlight so it was pretty 
   damn dark by 10:30. Luckily Tom had at least half a volt 
   left in his headlight so if you squinted real hard you could almost 
   see. <i>-grin-</i>
   </td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-5-9</td><td>20.1</td>
   <td>Mostly technical side track on the Wabash w/ Eli. Only hit 1 tree
   and crashed twice. I think I'm getting the hang of this biking thing.
   Made it up the hill from hell for the first time too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-5-4</td><td>19.9</td>
   <td>Keystone to Fort and back. It was supposed to rain but I figured
   that couldn't hurt. Got all the way to Fort before I finally turned around
   and saw the black, windy, rainy lightning storm that had followed me 
   north. Doh!</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-04-26</td><td>20.0</td>
   <td>Keystone to Fort and back. Broke out the new light kit on this cold,
   foggy, drizzly night. Not quite sure why I used the ass blinker (who's
   going to come up on me from behind 
   so fast they don't see me when I'm going 20 and
   there's no mororized vehicles on the trail?) but I did anyway. Also found
   out that if you adjust your rear brake so it doesn't rub constantly than
   you can peddle <i>less</i> for the same speed. Go figure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-04-24</td><td>13.9</td>
   <td>1/2 or 2/3 dirt riding w/ Eli on the Wabash. Feels good to do the
   dirt thing again -- biking is OK, but dodging trees and pushing like
   hell up steep inclines is the good stuff! Poked a hole in my new front
   tube! That makes 3 times on the Keystone while Eli (same route, mostly)
   hasn't lost one yet. What's up with that?</td></tR>
<tr><td>1999-04-19</td><td>22.4</td>
   <td>Up the Keystone to Fort and back. Weird that this was 2.5 miles more
   that usual... Meeting up with Alessia (<i>"hi Alessia!"</i>) on rollerblades
   and going slower must have thrown off the odometer somehow? Beautiful
   weather (among other things -grin/drool-).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-04-10</td><td>16.6</td>
   <td>If you didn't know already, 19 mile an hour head winds suck.
   I went down the Keystone to check out the rumor I heard about the 
   extension. Turns out it doesn't go any farther than it did (but
   they have brought out a bunch of construction equip). The way back 
   felt like 20 miles easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-03-21</td><td>19.8</td>
   <td>Up to Fort and back. Met an Air Force guy named Ron who was telling 
   me all about
   the fun to be had on Ragbrai... It's in late June -- I wonder if I'd be
   good enough by then to bike 500 miles (75 / day)?</td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-03-14</td><td>8.5</td>
   <td>Wow. 34 degrees <i>is</i> too cold for shorts and no gloves. Especially
   when you go through those puddles. <i>Brrr...</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>1999-02-14</td><td>19.9</td>
   <td>Up to Fort and back on the Keystone. My butt hurts -- haven't
   biked since fall.</td></tr>
