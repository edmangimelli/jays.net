So, Jay, you've been meandering around this planet for 25 years now. How are things going?
<br><br>

Quite well. I never worry about money. I'm well fed. I'm healthy.
I've got a nice supply 
of toys to keep me busy. I've been a home owner (the youngest I know) for nearly a year now
and no repo men have any reason to bother me. I've got a good job that I enjoy. I work with
good people. My boss is a good man who gets the job done and gives me full reign of 
everything under my department's realm of responsibility. We control strong, 
stable technologies 
and continue to implement them well. Things keep improving. Few, controlable explosions
disrupt the daily flow. My employees are 
good at their jobs.  I rarely have to prod anyone on the fundamentals. I guide a lot 
of our activities, but am increasingly comfortable with a growing circle of not needing
to sweat the details, and the implementations thereof. I'm / we're hiring yet another 
programmer. That'll put my department's headcount at 9 professional computer nerds. 
$125,000,000 in sales has been generated by the systems I'm responsible for in the 10
months I've held this job. Another $240,000,000 in revenue sourced at our hotels in the
same period flows through, and is augmented by, our systems. People keep telling me I'm
doing a good job and they're paying me well, so it looks like I did the right thing 
dropping out of college after only 3 semesters 5 years ago (as a Philosophy
major). It's not a constant cutting-edge technology challenge, but it certainly is an excellent
"get the job done in corporate America" growth experience. I plan on staying with Omni until
at least my 3-year anniversary.

Do you realize that I asked you the very open question "how are things going," 
and you spent 95% of your time talking about work?

<br><br>

...  

<br><br>

That's the framing for my life that I'm accustomed to. Monday through Friday I show up at
work around 9 and work until 7 or 9 (or, occasionally, midnight or 4am). I go home, cook something,
and unplug watching the Learning Channel or equivalent. I rarely work weekends anymore, but
weekends seem to bundle themselves into tight balls of a singular, miscellaneous, disposable 
activity of some kind: biking, tennis, movies, plunking around with jays.net, the 
occasional trip out of town, occasional outings of alcohol, billiards, and idle chatter.

Well, most people spend a lot of time with a significant other. Dating. Getting Married. 
Raising a family.<br><br>
How's the love life?

I'm pretty sure I don't have one of those. I suppose I could claim that I don't have time
for that particular pursuit, but the truth is more of a combination of choosing not to make
the time, and a general lack of interest in spending the endless, requisite blocks of of it
with anyone. At least, anyone I've met so far. It's not that I'm anti-social, it's just
that I'm not an aggressively social person like most party-people that I know. I
