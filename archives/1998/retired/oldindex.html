What can one say about, Jay, really? 
(Other than the fact that he's <a href="/house/">building a house</a>,
<a href="/parisphotos/">went to Paris</a>, and recently unearthed his 
<a href="/isu/people.html">ISU Philosophy Club bio</a> from 1994).
One could prattle on endlessly over the
trivalities of years past -- there was the birth event in Independence, 
Missouri, the moves to Lethbridge (Alberta) and Detroit. The
<i>formative</i> years in Sioux City (Iowa) colliding with girls, driver's
licenses, alcohol, first jobs, heartbreak, friendships, the occasional 
fullback, "responsibilty," the threat of college. There was college: grades,
fraternity brothers, heartbreak, "role modeling," 
alcohol, political ponderings,
philosophical hypothesizings, tifts with that God fellow. College ended on
a promise (threat?) of <i>reality</i>. The money was good, and he could
always go back if things didn't work out, right? Things seemingly worked out
 -- a couple years in the sticks (Yankton, South Dakota) learning the rigors
of <i>leadership</i> and <i>character</i> and <i>integrity</i>: the rhetoric
of those transcendentally inspired by vocations of their own ecclectic 
harvest. Things changed (as they opt to do), and he found himself amoung 
the comfortably semi-urban folk of Omaha, Nebraska. A job relocation, and 
<i><b>Voila!!</b></i> -- we find our hero deeply engrossed in the throngs 
of ... ... ... what?
<p>
Here lies the challenge. Much time has been spent carefully calculating the
next turn, the fastest, shortest route to the goals of the moment. But
things are not as mysterious as they once were. The world is full of familiar
faces where once a great adventure lay. The focus has shifted -- where a 
single, vaulted peak once beckoned those that dare challenge the summit, now
a grassy plain offers a vast array of mundane, common pleasures. Active 
exploration has given way to the mundane study of contentment...

Hmmm. Sorry about that, I'm not sure that any of that made sense. But, hey,
its long, and I've got a lot of space on this server so you're just going
to have to live with it. 
<p>
In case my narrator was vague, the HR guy at work calls me a Senior Software
Engineer (programmer). Work is a telecommunications company called Viatel
(striving to be the AT&T of Europe). 
I work in Business Systems Development (BSD),
a subset out Business Information Systems (BIS), located 10 degress 
NNE of Operations (Operations). 
I program Perl, Informix (DB design/devel & 4GL), and 
Internet integration projects (did I mention I'm also Viatel's webmaster?
Don't blame me for the 
<a href="http://www2.viatel.com/">public webpage</a>, though).
Feel free to look over <a href=/resume.pdf>my resume</a>.

<a href="dgolf.html">disc golf</a>, 
<a href="http://www.theatreartsguild.com/">community theatre</a>, 
<a href="http://204.26.80.70:8080/chess/">chess</a> (last time I looked, I was 
<a href="http://www.cis.uab.edu/info/faculty/sloan/ACF/ByState/NE.USCF">ranked
201st</a> (up 1!) in the state of Nebraska, unless you 
<a href="http://www.64.com/cgi-bin/ratings.pl/USCF/12732212">query
