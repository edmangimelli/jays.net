Greetings --<p>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">As the Philosophy Club's unofficial computer-task
exploitee, I've been given the honor of contacting you on behalf of the
glorious afore-mentioned organization to fill you in on the latest
happenings of this semester's highly-motivated club members. Throughout
the course of this hastily written and spell-checker-lacking letter I
will attempt to relate my fairly accurate (?) impression of what it is
we are planning on accomplishing this semester, or at least the general
direction which we are currently planning to direct our combined
energy. Please feel free to ignore my blabbering on any topic you deem
unworthy of concentration...<p>

<h2>
(1) Philosophy Club? What do you do in a Philosophy Club?
</h2>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">The traditional role that our club has filled (at
least in my limited experience) is to provide people with interest in
philosophical questions the opportunity to explore those topics in an
environment which facilitates open discussion, debate, and the
consumption of FREE pizza &amp; pop. Typical topics discussed are such
diverse questions as:
<ol type="1">
<li>Is there a God? What is he/she like?
<li>What exactly is morality? How does it apply to us? How do I know
what actions are moral / immoral?
<li>Which of the world's many religions is correct? How can we find out?
<li>Is reading Hegel really necessary? Is it even a good idea?
<li>How can I successfully convince the person sitting next to me to
give me their wallet?
</ol>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">If you've never been to a philosophy club meeting, I highly
recommend that you try it once. It's free, it's thought provoking and we
have food. No matter what the topic you're interested in, the chances
are that someone would be more than happy to explore it with you.

<h2>
(2) Where does the Philosophy Club meet?
</h2>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">We traditionally meet at DaVinci's, which is located
just west of Quick Trip in campustown. Meetings are currently slated for
every other Friday, making the next meeting land on Fri,
Sep. 29. Everyone is welcome.

<h2>
(3) &quot;Highly motivated,&quot; eh? What else are you planning?
</h2>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">In addition to the non-stop action of bi-monthly club
meetings, we are in the process of organizing several events of
monumental proportions, including:
<ol type="1">
<li>Local forum(s) for student paper presentation(s) (readings)
<li>Guest speakers on philosophical topics
<li>Programs for increased faculty-student interaction (Phil
           dept.)
<li>Some form of highly-memorable VEISHA participation
<li>Local debates (all-campus, philosophically orientated)
<li>Trips to conferences in the area
<li>Formation of Philosophy honorary society
<li> ... ad infinitum (approx.)
</ol>

<h2>
(4) Fascinating. How can I get more information?
</h2>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">Glad you asked. At this very minute, I'm plotting the
construction of a web site for the club. It should be fairly useful
shortly, including all information regarding club meeting times and
related events. It can be reached at:<p>

<h2>
(6) Isn't this ever going to end?
</h2>

<img src="tab.gif" WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="1">Sure is. I've run out of things to comment on, so I
think I'll stop now. If you have any questions about anything club
related, or need me to explain Kant's second derivitive of the
categorical imperative from his _Grounding of the Metaphysics of
Morals_, just let me know.<p>


        Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you on the 29th!
