<h2>What</h2>

Housing for W.O.O.D.'s wedding party May 7th and 8th in Chicago.

<h2>Where</h2>

<a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/default.asp?h_id=13">Omni Chicago 
Hotel</a>

<h2>Rules for Staying at the Omni</h2>

I want everyone to have fun w/ the W.O.O.D. I expect to have
a lot of fun myself. Honest.<p>

There are, however, many types, volumes, and extremes of fun which are
<b>NOT</b> appropriate for the Omni under any circumstances.<p>

Why? Because I work for Omni. My wife works for Omni. I have a wife, 
a child, a career, and a mortgage to pay and I have no intention of letting
any member of our entourage do anything to jeopardize my obligations.<p>

The Omni Hotel is my place of business, not an anonymous random pit stop 
in the heart of Chicago.<p>

If you have any intention of bringing any raucous, drunken behavior back to 
the hotel we need to make alternate housing arrangements 
for you. If you can't hold your alcohol, or choose to drink beyond your 
capacity to behave in a mature or sleepy manner you will not be staying
at the Omni that night. I will personally drop you off in a random park 
somewhere and come back to get you in the morning.<sup>1</sup><p>

You don't have to act like you just came from a funeral. You do have to 
treat the Omni like your mother's house<sup>2</sup>.<p>

Specifically:
<ul>
<li>No obnoxious / abusive / loud / screaming behavior
<li>No booze in the rooms. We'll be drinking plenty before packing it in for
the night (at least I will). The Omni is for sleeping, showering, etc. Not 
for boozing / partying.
<li>No puking. Careful puking in the toilet at 5am after quietly trying to 
sleep it off is OK. Puke in the lobby, the receptionist area, or randomly
in the room and I <b>will</b> hurt you. 
<li>No damage to the hotel, rooms, or yourself on the premesis
<li>No strippers / prostitutes / smut<sup>3</sup>
<li>No drugs
</ul>

I'm pulling strings to save us money. <b>PLEASE</b> do not make me regret
it. I have a lot to lose, and corporate tolerance for stupid, reputation
marring mistakes is very low.<P>

Do not get me fired.<p>

Please.<p>

Thank you.<br><br>

<h2>Rooms</h2>

I have secured 5 rooms for the nights of May 7th and 8th. They are suites,
each with one king bed and one sofa bed. The sofa beds are the size of
a double bed. I am told "one adult can fit comfortably" in the sofa bed.
The rooms are 400 sqr. feet. If we fill the beds rollaway cots are an option.
When we go to check in they may have double/double rooms available 
(2 double beds). Those rooms are more expensive but we could probably switch
if the hotel hasn't filled.
<p>

Last I heard we're tenatively expecting 12 people, not all of whom are
definate. 5 rooms should be OK. 
If people want to grab the floor (or cots)  we could shove 4 in each room. 
If we want more rooms I can try to get more.
