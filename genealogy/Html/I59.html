Hiram S Stark obit--Fairfield Ledger<br>
Hiram Sylvester or as his many friends knew him, "Hi," was the one child of Henry Harrison and Sarah Elizabeth Stark.  He was born on a farm west of this city and all of his life was spent in Jefferson County, in or just west of Fairfield.  For the past 42 years he has resided on the farm where he passed away at 1:30 a.m. Monday morning of last week.    He was married on January 1, 1884 to Elizabeth Schlief and lived happily in thisunion for over 50 years.  Eight children were born to them, all of whom survive excepting Willie who died in infancy.  The surviving relatives are, his sorrowing wife, his seven children, Mrs. Charles Hidy of Batavia, Ia., Mrs Loren Six of Fairfield, Mrs. Jess Louth of Libertyville, Sylvester of Batavia, Henry of Salem, Mrs. Howard Ratcliff of Des Moines, and Loren of Fairfield.  Besides these there are 23 grandchildren and five great grandchildren and a large number of relatives and friends who will mourn his passing.    Mr Stark has been an 'Odd Fellow' for the past 35 years and served honorably in the offices of the order.  His end was very unexpected, he being ill but three hours, and his going was a shock to his many relatives and friends.  He was a good father and husband, upright and honest in all of his dealings, kindly and sincere in his life, loved and respected by his friends and his neighbors.  His friendliness and thoughtfulness have made a very great place for him in the hearts of his many friends.     Funeral services were held at the Hoskins Funeral Home on Wednesday afternoon, conducted by Rev. S. P. Williamson of the First Christian church.  The two vocal numbers, "Going Down the Valley" and his favorite hymn "The Sweet Bye and Bye," were beautifully sung by Miss Marie Scott and Maurice Long with Mrs. Gus Scott at the piano.  Pall bearers were members of the I.O.O.F. and the ritual of Order was carried out at the graveside with William Phipps as acting Noble Grand and S.P. Williamson as Chaplain. The remains were interred in Evergreen cemetery.<br>
