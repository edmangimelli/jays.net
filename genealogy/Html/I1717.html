Yet amid the privation of pioneer life, she bravely battled and successfully met the necessities of her family until 1864, when she was united in marriage with Robt. W. Bunker, with whom she pleasantly lived until 1869, when by his death she was again left a widow.  Since then she has made her home with her son, Wm. Bond, who was left a widower with two small children, to these the grandmother became mother.
