SOUTHEASTERN KANSAS<br>
---<br>
TEHAMA, KAS.  May 20, '97<br>
ED. NEWS: -  When requested to write a letter for the NEWS, the first thought was ,what shall I write.  It will not matter much as there will be plenty of room in the waste basket for it.   Arrived at Lone Station April 10.  How different the country looked from what I had anticipated .  Instead of a dry desert where nothing grew, everything looked green and beautiful.  Fruit trees and flowers in bloom, farmers almost through planting corn.  The country here derives its reputation from the western part of this state, but there is quite a difference, as there never has been an entire failure of crops in this county, and always have an abundance of fruit of all kinds.  They also have productive soil anda delightful climate.  It is not as warm in summer, and not as cold in winter as in Iowa; that is what the old settlers say; it is more thickly settled than Henry county; has good improvements and nice farms.  Here, as any place, people seem happy and contented.  We attend the Friends church at Timber Hill, one mile from here; was surprised to see so many people from your state.  Rev. W. Smith, A. Tomlinson, and Theo. Wilson, who used to reside in Salem, all inquire about the people there.  The people in this neighborhood are principally from Iowa and Ind. So you know they are all good people.<br>
Looking southeast over an expanse of timber, a distance of about four miles, we can see Bud Cammack's now house, and joining his farm is High Cooper, sr.   Five miles farther on, in the same direction, we can see quite plainly the great mining town, Galena.  The lead mines have over 5,000 men employed.  You can imagine how the streets are crowded, morning and evening, as the men go to and from their work.  The wages are $1.50 and $2.50 per day.  I think a comfortable living can be assured any one that intelligently cultivates small fruit and raise "garden truck," as the miners consume a great deal both of fruit and vegetables, and they depend largely on the farmers.<br>
Baxter Springs is situated in a good stock county.  Farmers are seeing the necessity of handling profitable cattle, sheep and hogs, for which they have a ready market both at home and abroad.  The Soldier's reunion at Baxter Springs commences Sept. 6th and continues to the 12th.  Wehope to entertain some of the Salem people.<br>
My brother's farm, "Blackberry Ridge," is on a diagonal from Columbus to Galena, and midway between.  He has a beautiful stock and fruit farm, consisting of 160 acres; has the largest blackberry patch around her; all kinds of fruit.  We seem rather isolated here as the house is situated on a hill.  We have three neighbors only a quarter of a mile away, but cannot see either of the house3s since the trees leaved out, but we know they are there and it is only a pleasant walk through the beautiful timber, the most picturesque scenes here I ever saw any place.  The road from Columbus to Galena is particularly attractive, the worst objections to the country is the "Corduroy roads."  They will have better roadsin the future.<br>
You can boast of your large corn crops; we of our fine fruit cropand rich lead mines.  We take as much interest here in education as any place.  Every town has two or three large school buildings; a nice frame school house every two miles.  In our district they had thirty scholars last winter, and teachers receive $30 per month.<br>
Esorette never looked so well as he does at the present time.  We are somewhat taken up with the country, but not so much but what we havetime to give an occasional thought to our friends in Salem.  If this should find favor with the editor will write this fall and tell you about our crops here.  Prospects for crops are good so far.  Have had a late season and ;plenty of rain.  We still have both sweet and Irish potatoes toeat, and in a few days will have new ones. They keep potatoes here in what they call a warm house; a house built with two walls filled in with sawdust.  One will not starve in this poor country if they only have energy enough to work.  Like every place else, there are some that live on the interests of their debts.<br>

CALIFORNIA LETTER<br>
Ed. News.<br>
Through the columns of your paper, want to thank our friends for letters and cards.  Seems impossible to write to each separately; will send greeting to one and all.  In our first year in California we have burned as much fuel as in Iowa; this has been the coldest winter on record, so they say.  If it snowed, someone would say, "something unusual"; if it rained, "something unusual"; if the sun shone two or three days in succession, "going to have a long dry spell, something unusual".  But at last we are enjoying sunny California, temperature 104.  Iowa is good enough for anyone.  That is not saying anything against our own little town Chico, which with a population of eighteen thousand, boasts of the largest natural park in the city limits, consisting of 1900 acres.  It also has the largest oak tree in the world.  One thousand men can stand under it all at once, although I have not seen this demonstrated; churches of nearly every denomination.  It is the largest city between Sacramento and Portland, has thirty-three daily trains, boat transportation on the Sacramento river, also the largest machine shops between Sacramento and Portland.  It is noted for its magnificent shade tree, streets lined with oranges, olives and palm trees, and lemons and figs grow in profusion.  This district leads in the production of almonds.  Alfalfa is cut five times without irrigation, seven times with.  It has a record of being the cleanest, most healthful and beautiful city in northern California; is connected with Sacrament and San Francisco by the Northern Electric and Antioch line; has a climate equal to "Italy", average sunshine 248 days in the year.  Itis the outing place for hunting and fishing parties, the best trout fishing and deer to be found in the state.  The surrounding country comes under the Government Iron Canon irrigation.  Main street is the State highway; her a double street car track is laid.   The continuation of the highway forms the Esplanade, the principal thoroughfare of Chico Vecina, a suburb of north of town.  This Esplanade consists of two wagon roads, foot and bicycle paths on the west, a wagon road and foot and bicycle path, with elm trees planted between on the east side.  The street car and wagon road, which also has elm trees planted between the road, making six rows of trees makes it a beautiful driveway.  Chico is built on the east side of the Sacramento valley, its orchards reaching to the foot hills ofthe Sierra Nevada, a distance of five miles; on the west the Coast Range, about 55 miles; Mt. Sarsen north, close enough for us to see its terrible eruption, but not close enough to be much alarmed.  One would have to se the scenery to appreciate it.<br>
Everette has a position as civil engineer with the largest rice company in the west.  Hope to see some of our Iowa people that live in California.  Our latch string hangs out at 5 X Olander street.  My heart goes out in sympathy to the mothers whose sons have enlisted and I want to say to the boys who have gone, "we will not forget you."  You will all be glad I do not write but once a year.  We are always anxious to get the paper from home.<br>

FROM ROSA C. FRAZIER<br>
Ed. News:  -<br>
Through the columns of your paper I want to wish you all happinessthe coming year and to explain why I did not send my mail Christmas greetings to my friends.  If you can realize what it is to nurse ten weeks, day and night in the flu, you know why I did not write; my thoughts were with you just the same.  During that time I nursed fifteen flu cases with wonderful success, as I was just called from one case to another; lost one case, other complications set in.  There were fifty deaths here in two weeks, and although not able, I felt it my duty to help I this terrible disease.  Christmas day I had to give up, so am resting in a large west window in the hospital.  I dodged the "flu" but caught the pneumonia.  Doctor had me in the hospital an hour after I called her; she introduced me as one of her "best nurses, too valuable to lose; do your best" and they have but am not improving very fast.  Now if you get the flu, first thing  get the poison out of your stomach; do not let it get in our system; eat copiously of castor oil or salts, chewing it well, go to bed for ten days or two weeks, having some one treat you with hot applications as for old fashioned lagrip.  The deceitfulness of the flu is that the lungs fill up without pain; consequently,  unless the patient is watched very close the patient may be almost beyond help before the nurse or doctor discovers it; that is the cause of so many deaths. Another reason people have died for the want of care because people were not willing to risk their lives; have actually run when they saw some one coming that had been caring for some poor sufferer.  Now I argue that we are not showing the bravery that we admire in our soldier boys; how ashamed they would have been if their boys had run when they saw the "Huns"; if we had all showed the same bravery and fight we expect ofour dear boys we might have saved many lives.  I certainly would hate toface the boys coming home if I had stayed at home and let some of their relatives die.  I know of such cases and hope you did not have any 'slackers" there.  I get so indignant when I think of it, but I mustring off and rest.  "Iola II" please write again, lost your address before I got time to answer.  Everette has not been discharged yet; they sentfor him though, am sure.<br>
