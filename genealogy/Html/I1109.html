OBITUARY.<br>
____<br>
Marion McVey was born in Indiana Sept. 26, 1840, died Jan 26, 1899, aged 58 yrs., 4 months.  When a boy 10 years old he, with his parents John and Eliza D. McVey, came to Iowa and has been a resident in Salem vicinity all of his life, except 2 years, 1862-3, was spent in Indiana at the place of his birth, also one year in crossing the plains to Denver, Colo. in 1865.  Deceased was united in marriage Sept. 24, 1879 to Charity Scarborough.  This union was blessed with seven children, three having preceded the father to the better world.  Three sons and one daughter remain to comfort the bereaved mother; Guy J., Melvin M., Forest L.,and Eunice E.   He is also survived by his father, one brother and two sisters.  For two years his health has been gradually failing and his suffering has been great, but he bore it patiently.  All had been done that could be, and his death had been expected for some time.  He had heart trouble so bad that he could not lie down, but slept in his chair. He had been better for several days which made his death seem sudden, being found by his wife in his chair, asleep as it were, about 4 o'clock in the morning when she came in his room to build up the fire.  She had been up often during the night and he seemed as well as usual.  He was a kind and affectionate husband and father and his loss will be greatly felt in this vicinity as none knew him but to love him.  Rev. Roberts said he was one of the best men he ever knew.<br>
The funeral services took place at the family residence .... Rev.W. W. Roberts, of Mt. Pleasant, he being a favorite friend of the deceased. The text, chosen by the wife, was Matt. 24:42; "Watch therefor, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."  The singing was led by Mrs. W. W. Roberts and daughter.  The first song "Shall we gather at the river." was a favorite of the deceased.  The pall bearers were his nephews, R. E. Hoyt, Lin Byers. Milton Knight, Fred Knight, George Bunker, and Henry Scarborough.  The remains were laid to rest in the M. E. cemetery.<br>
The eyes that ached with pain so long,<br>
Had peacefully fell asleep.<br>
The lips had left a pleasant smile,<br>
That told us all was peace.<br>
<br>
A chair is vacant in the house,<br>
That never can be filled;<br>
But we must think that all is right,<br>
For it as Thou has't willed.<br>
R. C. S.
