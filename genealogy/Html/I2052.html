J. E. ROBERTS<br>
Mt. Pleasant News<br>
The announcement of the death of Mr. J. E. Roberts, son of Mrs. W.W. Roberts living south of this city, came as a surprise and brought sadness into the hearts of his many friends.  He was well known here and married a Miss Collins of near Salem.  The following clipping is taken from a Nevada paper and tells of the love and esteem in which the deceased was held.<br>
Wells, Nevada, June 8. - A telegram received here about nine o'clock Wednesday evening conveyed the information that J. E. Roberts, son of Rev. and Mrs. W. W. Roberts of Mt. Pleasant, Ia., died at Goldfield that evening shortly after five o'clock.  The news was startling, as few people in wells knew that he was even sick.  Pneumonia was the causeof death.<br>
The deceased was well known in this vicinity, having resided in this neighborhood for about fifteen years.  Shortly over a year ago he disposed of his interests here and removed with his family to Goldfield, where he has been engaged in conducting a lodging house.<br>
Not long after going to Goldfield, he was stricken with typhoid fever and for a number of days hovered on the brink of eternity.  It is probable that he had not fully recovered from his illness when stricken with pneumonia.<br>
J. E. Roberts was a native of Iowa, having been born in Lee county, about sixteen miles from Mt. Pleasant, about 36 years ago.  Early inlife he married the young lady, who now survives him as a widow, and a short time thereafter came to wells.  From that time until his removal to Goldfield he had lived with his family in Clover and Starr Valleys and on the U-7 ranch north of Wells.  To mourn his untimely demise he leaves in this state a heart-broken wife and two children of Goldfield; a sister, Miss Minnie Roberts of Starr Valley and an uncle, Dillon Roberts of Clover.<br>
J. E. Roberts was a whole-souled, energetic, hard-working man, honest, conscientious and reliable.  He was a devoted husband and father andwill be mostly missed by the bereaved widow and children.  To them especially, and to the other relatives, the heartfelt sympathy of this communityis extended in their hour of great sorrow.  Mere words of sympathy seemto them as empty mockery in their sad, dark hour, and do little to assuage the grief that is assailing their hearts, and only the God who has given and who hath taken away can furnish relief.  May He tide them through the dark shadow that now engulfs them, and heal the wounds caused by thehand of death.<br>
The remains will be transported here for interment and the funeralwill take place tomorrow.<br>

The Salem Weekly News May 2 ,1907<br>
The remains of J. E. Roberts and his little son, son and grandson of Mrs. Will Roberts, were brought to Mt. Pleasant last Friday from Goldfield, Nevada.   The young man died last June of Pneumonia and was buried in Wells by the side of his son who died some time before.  Mrs. Roberts is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Collins.  She was accompanied on her way here by her sister-in-law, Miss Minnie Roberts, who has been teaching in Nevada the past year.
