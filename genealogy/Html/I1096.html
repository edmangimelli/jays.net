Notes: <br> Salem News January 20, 1916<br>
FROM NEBRASKA<br>
Ed. NEWS:<br>
I am enclosing a money order for one dollar for a renewal of my subscription to the Salem News.  We are living about one hundred miles west of the Missouri river in Wheeler county, Nebraska, in a rather thinly settled part of the country.  We have a farm here of 320 acres, with the Francis post office in our house of which I am postmistress. Land is changing hands around us, and more settlers coming each year.  We are twenty miles from Ericson, our nearest railroad, and thirty miles from O'neill a railroad Junction, and the mail is carried by stage to this office;  so you see the Salem News is like a visit from an old friend each week, as I was born and raised five miles east of Salem,and my thoughts will always wander back to the old home town.  I can hardly realize the many changes that have taken place in the last eighteen years that I have been away; so many of the old neighbors around the old Donaldson chapel, and friends in and around Salem have passed away, and the little boys and girls that were mere babies when I knew them arenow grown up and in business for themselves, and many scattered to the different states.  We moved from Donnellson, Iowa in the spring of 1909 to Page, Nebr., and lived there on 320 acres until the spring of 1913 when we sold our farm and bought here at Francis.  The climate here is fine, and we have  an abundance of he best of soft water; we are in the flowing well district, where at the depth of 125 feet the water spouts out of the ground several feet high through a small gas pipe in the ground and flows the year around.   We had a very rainy season in 1915, and crops were not very good, but this part of the country is more adapted to grazing than the raising of small grain, although  there is some farming done here with fairly good success.   Alfalfa, clover, and tame grass do well here.  Small fruit and all kinds of garden stuff do fine, and there are some very fine orchards here.  We are having a very nice winter so far, no snow to speak of .  There is lots of hay baled and shipped out of this country every year.  Cattle are doing well  this winter; we have 104 head of cattle and 10 head of horses on hay for the winter.  The school house is just across the road from our house andwe have eight months of good school.  I will close by wishing the NEWS and its patrons a happy and prosperous New Year.<br>
