Stanley, Ottis and Mary<br>
Mary Elizabeth Joy was born October 30, 1914, the tenth child to Reuben Folger Joy and Elizabeth (McIntosh) Joy on a farm northwest of Hays, Kansas.  A sister, Helen Ruth, and a brother, Arthur Clinton, were yet to follow, making a family of seven girls and five boys.<br>
I attended Buckeye Community School for three years, moving to Hays where I entered the public schools in the fourth grade.  I graduatedfrom Hays High School in 1933.<br>
On October 24, 1941, I was married to Ottis Stanley in Hays.  I acquired an eleven-year-old son, Ottis, Jr.  On November 11, 1942, our daughter Minnie Elizabeth, was born, followed by Bob Stanley on August 7, 1952.<br>
We were in the oil field business and lived many places from the Canadian border to the Mexican border, settling in Hays when Minnie started school.<br>
Both Minnie and Bob are living in California. Minnie married Cedric Scott, and they have a son Matthew.  Bob married Joyce Holden of Chicago and they separated two years later.  They have a daughter, Dawn.<br>
For the past twenty-two years I have been employed as a sorority house director at UCLA, retiring June 1990.  I now live in Pasadena, California.<br>
Both Minnie and Bob attended Hays public schools.  Minnie attendedFort Hays two years and was a member of Delta Zeta sorority.  Bot joined the army and served in Germany.  He was overseas when his father passed away.  submitted by Mary Elizabeth (Joy) Stanley
