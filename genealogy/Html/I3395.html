Notes: <br> Salem News Sept. 29, 1932<br>
REUBEN FOLGER JOY<br>
(Hayesville, Kas., News)<br>
The son of Lindley and Esther Ann Joy, Reuben Folger, was born Jan. 18, 1869, at Salem ,Iowa, and passed away Sept. 20, 1932 at Hays, Kas., at the age of 63 years, 8 mon, and 2 days.  In his boyhood he attended the public schools of Salem and later Whittier college, a school in Salem maintained by the Quakers.  In these schools and in a Quaker home he received his early education.  His Quaker ancestry made him a birthright member of the Society of Friends.<br>
He learned the carpenter trade at which he worked along with his father during those early years.<br>
In 1892 Mr. Joy came to Kansas, and her he was married, March 30, 1895, in Hays, to Miss Elizabeth McIntosh.  Over the greater part of the period since that time he was teacher in the public schools, combining in later years that vocation with  farming.  In 1925 he removed with his family form the farm to the city of Hays where he continued to reside untilthe time of his death.<br>
About six years ago ill health finally forced his retirement from active service.  Mr. Joy had a good memory, was fond of reading, well informed regarding current events, retained his intellectual interests to the last, and all this together with his devotion to his excellent family of children and grandchildren helped alleviate the years of invalidism. Many old friends and former pupils, as well as his immediate family will cherish his memory.<br>
These remain to mourn his death: his wife, Elizabeth; 12 children,Jas. L. Joy, Mrs. Andrew Jensen, Mrs. C. E. Stackhouse, Reuben F. Joy, Jr., Mrs. Harry Ostrom, Mrs. Theo Gosser, Mrs. Jack Drees, Henry ,Hiram, Mary, Helen and Arthur Joy, all of Hays; also 223 grandchildren; his uncle, Gideon Joy of Hays, and two sisters, Mrs. Grant Corsbie of Ft. Madison, Ia. and Mrs. Bert Foster of Los Angeles Calif.
