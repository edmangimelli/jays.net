Obituary<br>
For Free Press: -<br>
Owen W., third son of John and Catherine Hannah, of Jackson township, Henry county, was born October 19, 1867, and died June 26, 1891.  Onthe 16th day of March he was taken sick with grippe.  After rallying from the first attack he was so much improved that the family felt quite hopeful. About the 1st of May he  was able to ride to the field where his brothers were engaged in planting corn.  But as is so frequently the case, that dread disease left in his system a serious complication of difficulties, which medical skill and most tender and patient nursing could not overcome.  During the last six or eight weeks of his illness, he gave frequent evidence of improvement, but only to again relapse into a condition weaker and less able to conquer.  Five years ago he professed religion and joined the M.E. Church.  On the 19th day of November, 1889, he was united in marriage to Miss Mary E. Courter, of Scott township. The afflicted young wife, parents sister and brothers have the sympathy of a large circle of their neighbors and friends, many of whom were present at the funeral on Sabbath.  He was buried from Donaldson Chapel, the remains being interred in the cemetery at Salem.     T. S. Pool
