Notes: <br> Salem Weekly News March 19, 1903<br>
MRS MASON MILLER<br>
Mrs. Mason Miller passed away Tuesday morning, March 10, at 4:25 o'clock.<br>
Sarah Ann Miller was born in Sarahville, Ohio, Oct. 14, 1843; moved with her parents about the year 1850 to Ipavia, Fulton county Illinois. Was married to Mason Miller at Ipavia, May 26, 1867.  To this union were born four children, Marion, of Indian Territory; Mrs. Kate Rose, living west of Salem; Elmer, who resides in Salem; and Lucy, at home, all of whom with the loving husband survive.<br>
Deceased had been in rather poor health ever since coming to Salem about six years ago, and the past four months was noticeable declining until about three weeks ago she was stricken with paralysis from which she never fully rallied and which was the immediate cause of her death. She was a good Christian woman and was of a forbearing disposition that made friends of all with whom she came in contact.  She was a Methodist by faith but had seldom attended church here on account of ill health. She died as she lived, triumphant in the faith, and passed peacefully away at the age of 59 years, 4 mon., and 25 days.<br>
Funeral services, conducted by Rev. T. S. Pool of Mt. Pleasant, were held at the home Wednesday, March 11, at eleven o'clock a.m., after which the remains were laid at rest in the M. E. cemetery.<br>
Mother's gone and we're so lonely<br>
Mother- sweetest name e'er spoke.<br>
In her love our hearts found shelter,<br>
When life's storms and tempest broke.<br>
Mother's gone, the Master called her,<br>
He who died her soul to save.<br>
And she's gone in triumph homeward.<br>
Tho' her pathway's through the grave.
