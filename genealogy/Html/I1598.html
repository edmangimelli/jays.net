HANNAH R. HAMILTON<br>
Hannah Rosetta  Hamilton was born in Plainfield, Ind., Dec. 22, 1833. She with her family emigrated from her native home to Iowa, before it became a state.  At 22 years of age she was united in marriage, near Ackworth Iowa, to George Hamilton.  To this union there were  given five children: four sons, James, John, Charles, and Elmer, and one daughter, Mrs. Eva Vining.  They moved from Iowa to Kansas 41 years ago.  Coming to his state at that early period necessitated a continuation of the hard times that all of the early settlers had to undergo.  The hard times of frontier life did not discourage nor harden her spirits, but softened and sweetened her character.  She was reared a Quaker, but after coming to womanhood she was baptized and joined the Baptist church, in which church she remained a member for 53 years.  Her transfer came January 30, when God called her from the church militant to the church triumphant  tobe with himself.  Mrs. Hamilton's maiden name was Bunker.  Her father was one of the laborers who was employed in excavating the Erie canal.  He began work on the canal the first day and continued his work with the company, and continued his work until the completion of the canal, receiving advanced wages for every day, during the entire time takento complete the canal, for his total abstinence from liquor.  Mrs. Hamilton 's great grandfather owned the farm upon which was fought the famous battle of Bunker Hill.  The last 20 years of her life was spent in the home of her daughter Mrs. Eve Vining.  Her last sickness was for a few days only, being caused by a fall in which one of her bones was broken. Her three sisters from out of town and her own children were all present at the funeral, which was held from the Methodist church, conducted by the pastor. a By request the choir sang as the closing hymn, "Beautiful Beckoning Hands.' Interment was made in the city cemetery.- Horton (Kas.) Headlight Commercial.
