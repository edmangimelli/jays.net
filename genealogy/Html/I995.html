COMMUNITY SERVICE<br>
The community service held at the Methodist church last Sunday evening brought out a good attendance.  The sermon by Rev. D.S. Staebler of Mt. Pleasant was an impressive presentation of prayer and its answers, and it was listened to with much interest.  Mr. Leo Hannah gave a fine violin solo which was greatly appreciated.<br>
The service next Sunday evening will be held in the Congregational church at 8 o'clock.  Special music will be rendered by the Gospel Team quartet and Rev. Sams.<br>
All are invited to attend this service.<br>
