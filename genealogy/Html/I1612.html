Notes: <br> "Marie" was a twin, the other baby died at birth.  Marie weighed 2 or 2 1/2 lbs.  Dr. didn't think she would live.  Margaret Byers insisted they keep her warm and put her in a shoe box and fed her with an eye dropper. She grew into a fine healthy girl.  Then typhoid came along and she never recovered from it.  She was probably born at Tama, Iowa also.<br>
Milton Knight worked for the railroad on the section in Tama.  Laterthey moved and rented a farm from people named "Apple" about 5 miles from Malcolm.  Margaret spoke of Booklin so it must have been between Malcolm & Brooklin.  They moved by train from there to Memphis, Mo. Years later to Charleston, Iowa where they both died.<br>
