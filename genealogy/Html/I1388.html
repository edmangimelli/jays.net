HAYS WOMAN LIVES ON<br>
SITE OF OLD ROME<br>
---<br>
Mrs. J. H. O'Loughlin, With Parents,<br>
Occupies House One Mile West<br>
Of Hays in 1879<br>
---<br>
(By Mrs. J. H. O'Loughlin)<br>
I spent my ninth birthday, April 1, 1879 in a covered wagon en route from Coon Rapids, Iowa, to Ellis County, Kansas.  My father had soldoff all of his farming equipment a few days before and rigged up a wagonwith a canvas cover and painted it on the side with big red letters, "Kansas or Bust."   My Mother's two brothers fitted up their wagons in a similar fashion and made the trip with us.  Our kitchen table was turned upside down and used for a bed for my younger sister.  Our family was composed of five children, three girls and two boys, ranging in age from eleven years to one year.  Our parents and my brothers and sisters all slept in the covered wagon at night, but we cooked and ate our meals along the roadside.  When we crossed the Missouri river at Nebraska City, father drove the team and wagon onto a ferry boat and we children were verymuch frightened.  Father kept talking to his team, as they got excited and tried to jump over the railing into the water.<br>
When we reached Sterling, Nebraska, a sad accident occurred.  My little cousin, who was about two years old pulled over the coffee pot whilemy aunt was preparing dinner and scalded her head and arms so badly that she died within a few hours.  We buried the little one the next day at Sterling and proceeded on our way, but we had lost the high spirits and disposition for fun-making with which we had started the trip.<br>
We often stopped at the little towns along the way to buy some supplies and make inquiries about the road.  The settlers laughed when they saw the sign on the wagon and said it would be "bust' when we did get to Kansas.<br>
Arrived at Rome<br>
At Osborn, Kansas, my father bought a cow which we tied to the wagon. In a few days, (April 20, 1879) we landed in Ellis County, Kansas, without seeing any of the Indians that we had heard so much about.  We traveled along Big Creek and finally drove across a big dam which we later found supplied the water power for operating I. M. Yost's flour mill in Hays.  We landed at a place on the south side of Big Creek, about a mile west of Hays, which was called Rome.  This site had formerly had been an Indian village and was later occupied as a railroad camp. However when we arrived the only trace of the former occupancy was a large stone house with two long rooms, a small stable and a small mound in the front yard which was covered with little shells and beads of every color.<br>
Our family lived in the big house which was about opposite the place where the railroad bridge west of Hays is now located.  Our only neighbor was a Mr. Strosser, who lived in the small dug out in the south bankof the creek in which he operated a brewery.<br>
We were very much disappointed when we did not see the buffalo, the deer and the antelope which were reported to be so abundant in this wild country.  However, within a few days we were rewarded with the sightof a real live buffalo, but it was already in captivity and was being ledat the end of a rope.  We later saw large herds of deer and antelope along the Saline river and often had venison and antelope meat to feast on.<br>
The numerous buffalo wallows on the prairies were probably the inspiration for the following lines which I have clipped from some forgotten source.<br>
" The Kansas Dust"<br>
---<br>
"Out of the dust of Kansas,<br>
In old primeval days;<br>
Out of the shroud of a drifting cloud,<br>
Across its grassy ways.<br>
Flaunting the flag of the prairie dust<br>
The shaggy bison's graze.<br>
Over a landscape red with rust<br>
The herds emerge from the Kansas dust"<br>
<br>
Hair Curlers from Bullets<br>
We lived close to the military reservation and could watch the soldiers at drill and target practice.  We used to go over and pick up the bullets.  My brothers used them in their guns but my sisters and I placed them upon the railroad track and let the train flatten them out so we could use them for hair curlers. The soldiers cut ice in the Big Creek and often came to our house to get warm.  They told us about their long hikes with their knapsacks on their backs.  We often saw them as they walked over to Plainville and back.<br>
I still remember a little incident which happened soon after we arrived.  One of my cousins was exhausted when her returned from fishing in Big Creek and laid down between the railroad tracks and went to sleep.  The trains ran very infrequently, but a train happened to come along soon after and had almost passed over the boy before the engineer discovered him. The bell on the engine awakened the sleeping youngster and he jumped up just in time to see a colored porter who was running down the track to see if he was hurt.  My cousin was so frightened at the sight of the negro, that he ran all the way home, where we were all out in the front yard  wondering why the train had stopped and why the bell was clanging.<br>
We spent hours picking the little fine Indian beads out of the dirt and making long strands to wear.  We often saw arrow heads which we collected.  In those early days the prairies were infested with many pests and reptiles.  A large spider known as the tarantula often invaded our house.  Centipedes, water-puppies, lizards and horny toads were also numerous.  When we went swimming we saw bull snakes, water snakes, and blue racers.<br>
We saw some hard times during those first few years, and lived mostly on corn bread and sorghum molasses.  Sometimes we did not even have the molasses and mother made us a gravy flavored with vinegar which we called "hard times."   We did not have any milk as the cow we purchased at Osborne died a few days after we reached our destination.<br>
<br>
Lived in Sod House<br>
The spring following our arrival at Rome, we moved about nine miles north of Hays and my father ran a breaking plow to turn up the sod for our house.  We had a two room "soddy" which was very warm in winter and cool in summer.   Father also built a sod stable for he horses and acoop for the few chickens which he had bought.  A new pest now appeared in the sod house, namely: fleas, but we discovered that a layer of milk weeds on the bed springs kept them away from us at night.<br>
At first we were confronted with the problem of getting water for ourselves and the livestock as the first well my father dug was dry. A man who traveled about "witching" for water came and tested the prospective locations with a peach tree limb.  A well was dug at the place he detected and was found to contain an abundant supply of water.<br>
We had just settled in our new home when a prairie fire threatenedto destroy everything.  The sparks from a train started a fire a few miles east of Hays.  A high wind was blowing and within a few hours it was raging near our home.  Our folks had gone to Hays and we were frantic with fear, so we lowered a ladder into the dry well and climbed down. The wind soon changed and the fire guards which the neighbors had plowedkept the fire from approaching any nearer.<br>
During the first year in our new home my father made a little money selling red cedar wood which he cut and hauled from along the Saline river.  We also helped him gather up bones of wild animals which were sold in Hays.  We also sold wild plums, grapes, choke cherries, hill cherries, currents and elderberries which we gathered along the creek.<br>
Planting Under Difficulties<br>
We prepared the soil for planting with a breaking plow and then used an ax of hatchet to make a hole in the sod, then dropped the seed and closed the hole with our heels.  The ground squirrels got part of our seed but we had very good crops the first year.  The next year we ran the sod cutter over this ground, harrowed it, and seeded it with wheat.<br>
During the winter of 1881 and 1882 we lived in Hays so that my older brother could go to school.  Mrs. Tom Gartland was his teacher.<br>
During that winter a colored regiment was stationed at Fort Hays. One afternoon a quarrel started in a saloon in Hays between some of the citizens and several of the colored soldiers.  The colored soldiers returned in the evening and threatened to burn the whole town and kill the marshal.  Charlie Bason, who was the marshal, hid under the platform of the depot while the troops were looking for him.  We lived in the first house north of the Catholic church.  During the evening we sawa blaze, but were afraid to go out as the colored soldiers had threatened to kill anyone who appeared to put out the flames.  The first house burned was a block south of the railroad track and the fire continued to spread until nearly the whole block was destroyed.  One brave citizen ran along Big Creek to the old fair grounds and swam across and gave the alarm to the captain.  This officer immediately mounted his horse and came over and lined up the colored troops and marched them back to the fort.   Within a few days they were shipped out of town.  But the prejudice against the colored people continued to run high and all of the colored inhabitants were forced to leave town at once.  This resentment against the negroes continues to this day and it is not safe for a man of the darker hue to let the sun set on his head in the city of Hays.<br>
In the spring of 1882 we moved back to the farm and my father had a sorghum mill shipped out from our old home in Iowa.   The neighbors near Catherine sold cane to us and we made molasses to sell.  Our food supplies were low that winter and the boys would often throw pitchforks at the snowbirds that gathered around the millet stacks and kill them by the dozen for pot pie.<br>
The prairie dogs were thick on our place and we had to drown them out. The prairie dogs, owls and both the black and gray rattlesnakes all lived in the same holes.  We occasionally saw a beaver, a wild cat, an opposum or a badger.  And one day my parents saw a mountain lion which was killed later three miles from our place.  My uncles had two pet antelopes which they fed on father's cabbage and tomatoes.  One of them got cross and bunted us over.<br>
Our chief amusements were horse back riding, dancing, and taffy pulls. We often gathered up a party of old and young people in a lumber wagon and went twenty miles across the prairie to a dance.  There were not roads or trails to follow and we sometimes got lost.  All of the people were very hospitable and strangers were always welcome and made to feel at home.<br>
School Organized<br>
During the fall of 1883 Anna Rasmussen taught a three months school in my uncle's house.  The next year District No. 41 was organized and anew school house was built.  The first teacher was William Thorp.<br>
The winter of 1886 was the hardest we ever experienced n Kansas.  The snow fell for three days and nights and no one could get out of the house because of the high snow-drifts.  One of our neighbors lost two hundred head of cattle in the storm and several people along the Saline river froze to death.  The wood supply had been almost exhausted during the previous winter and the people were then burning cow chips which they had stored during the fall.<br>
The next winter some ranchers in Texas brought their long horned cattle to graze on the Kansas plains.  The cowboys who accompanied them were a hard lot and they often drove the cattle onto our farms at night to eat up the feed, and if the farmer or his dog interfered their lives were in danger.<br>
Some one has said that the real pioneer in Kansas didn't wear any underwear, but this was not true of the Ellis county pioneer and the clothes lines with undergarments advertising I. M. Yost's High Patent flour were the best evidence.<br>
Not everyone in Western Kansas was poor in those early days and some of the prosperous newcomers in 1876 were German-Russians who started the settlements at Catherine, Munjor, Herzog and other points near Hays.They liked to work and had good farms which were well cared for.  Some ofthem with large families were not comfortably fixed and their children worked out as soon as they were old enough.<br>
Early Day Wedding<br>
In 1881 when Charley Howard was sheriff, a girl by the name of Barbara Corbey came from Munjor to do house work for his family.  Her familywere German-Russians and were well known in Hays.   When Barbara was married she had a big wedding celebration at her home in Munjor and most of Hays people were invited.  The bride wore a changeable green silk dress which Mrs. Howard had brought back from Germany and which she had folded into a bustle when she came through the customs.  The parish priest was called away, so the wedding festivities continued for five days until the ceremony was performed.   Several beeves had been butchered for the occasion and a special table with fancy cakes and decorations was set for the Hays people.   The bride and her family had a separate table with a large  bowl of soup and meat in the center from which all were served. The guests took turns eating, drinking and dancing the hochzeit withan occasional nap at the home of near neighbors.  Whiskey was passed around after each dance and the men smoked their long stem pipes, even while they were dancing.  Every man danced with the bride and greenbacks were pinned all over her dress by the guests.  Many other early settlers in Hays will remember other happenings at this wedding celebration.<br>
The cowboy has followed in the wake of the Indian and the buffalo; fenced fields and cultivated crops have taken the place of the rangeand the grazing herds of cattle; the tractor has supplanted the horse-drawn plow and the automobile has put the old phaeton and team out of business.  Kansas has kept pace with the march of progress, but we are glad to see remaining that old time hospitality, the kindly greetingto the stranger at our gates, the good fellowship, sociability and generosity which have made us so many friends.  Material wealth has its place, but let us not forget that the greatest riches of a nation are often found in the hearts of man.<br>

McIntosh, James and Cordelia<br>
<br>
James McIntosh was born October 18, 1843 at Bethel, Ohio, to Alexander and Mary J. (McCollum) McIntosh.  After growing up on the family farm, McIntosh enlisted at Bethel on January 24, 1865, in Company I, 184thOhio Infantry, for one years' service.<br>
Private McIntosh was unused to the southern climate in Alabama and became ill.  He was sent to the post hospital at Bridgeport on April16. With the surrender of Lee and Johnston, the War Department ordered McIntosh and all other sick and injured Union soldiers in hospitals mustered out of service on May 24.  Family lore says it was a very sick McIntosh who managed to make his way from Bridgeport to his home at Bethel, Ohio, after his discharge.<br>
A few years after the war McIntosh moved to Henry County, Iowa, where, in his own words, "we farmed in summer and went to the mines to dig coal in the winter with no prospect of making enough at either to get ahead." This problem became acute for him when he met and married Cordelia Byers April 18, 1867, and later became a father.<br>
His wife Cordelia was born June 8, 1846, in Huntington County, Indiana, to John and Mary E. (Daily) Byers.  Around 1853 the Byers family moved from Indiana to Henry County, Iowa, and settled on a farm six miles east of Salem.  They later moved into the town.  It was at Salem that Cordelia met and married McIntosh.<br>
McIntosh and his wife were the parents of six children:  George William (1868-1961); Mary Ellen O'Loughlin (1870-1938); Ida May Wirtz (1872-1918); John Alexander (1875-1948); Elizabeth "Lizzie" Joy (1877-1948); and Clara Belle Balls (1880-1978).<br>
The McIntosh family, accompanied by some of the wife's relatives, set out in covered wagons with "Kansas or Bust" painted on the canvas cover.<br>
McIntosh wrote his account of his arrival in Ellis County for the Ellis County News (March 28, 1929):  "On April 20, 1879, I came to Ellis County with my wife, five children and a team and wagon.  On arriving at Hays, then known as Hays City, we stopped at Henry Winters' and I receivedthe first information about the locality.  We lived in temporary quarters for several months, then settled in Buckeye Township.  I built a two-room sod house with ridge poles and boards, then sod and dirt for the roof.  There were windows on two sides and the inside was plastered and white - washed with natural lime.  This house was warm in winter and cool in summerand we never feared storms when we were inside."<br>
Further details about the McIntosh family's early experiences in Ellis County were provided by his daughter Mary E. O'Loughlin in an article in the News on March 21, 1929, and makes very interesting reading.<br>
In addition to farming, McIntosh served as postmaster in Bantam in Buckeye Township and, although not a doctor, provided knowledge on home remedies for the sick.<br>
After retiring from farming, and with his children married off and moved away from home, McIntosh and his wife settled in Hays.  Cordelia McIntosh passed away there March28, 1924.  McIntosh occupied his time with membership in the local Grand Army of the Republic organizationand never missed a parade in town.  He died March 5, 1929, and was buried in Mount Allen Cemetery next to his wife.  The funeral was presided over by members of Hays American Legion Post.  submitted by James D. Drees.<br>
