MRS. ZULA DELL SHORT<br>
Much Loved and Respected Mt.<br>
Pleasant Woman Passes to<br>
Her Reward<br>
It was with deep sorrow that the many friends of Mrs. Zula Dell Short, beloved wife of John Short, learned of her death, which took place in St. Bernard's Hospital, Chicago, Wednesday, February 23, 1916.  She was a daughter, and the oldest child, of John T. and Sarah D. McLaren, andwas born in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, July 18, 1874.  She grew to womanhood inthis city, attended the schools in her girlhood days, and in later years entered heartily into the activities of church and other society.  When she was twenty-two years of age the family circle was broken by the death of her father who was a veteran of the Civil War.  Her death is the first to occur in the family of six children, but two loved sisters-in-lawhave passed away.<br>
Early in life she gave her heart and life to God and united with the Christian church of this city where she was always an active and interested member.  At the time of her death she was vice-president of the Ladies Aid Society of the church and its members can fully attest to her untiring efforts in the way of service even when failing health was fast drawing on her strength.  She was a member of the building committee for the new church.  But the condition of her health prevented her even attending a service in the new building.  Her many freinds in the church will sadly miss her from their circle.<br>
She was also an active member of Crystal Rebekah Lodge, where she was honored with various offices of trust, and of McFarland W.R.C.  She bore an unusual respect for the old soldiers who wore the blue.  She was a member of the Monday Club also and greatly added to the pleasure of their gatherings.<br>
March 29, 1899 she and John W. Short were united in marriage.  Fora few years they resided on a farm south of this city.  Later they moved into town, where they builded them a home on S. Walnut street.  It was a happy home.  All who entered its walls enjoyed it hospitality and helpfulness.  Mrs. Short was of a sunny disposition and helped many by her kindly ways and generous heart.  She was most happy when making others happy.<br>
She leaves to mourn, her husband, her aged mother, one sister, Alice McLaren, of the Daily News staff, four brothers, Elmer of Sigourney, Gilbert of Fairfield; and Pearl and Will of Mt. Pleasant, and the aged mother-in-law, Mrs. Short, besides many other relatives.<br>
She was taken seriously ill in December last.  On January 17, she was taken to Chicago, where everything that could be done was done to relieve her suffering and to prolong her life.  But in spite of every effort, and despite her own earnest struggle to get well, the sorrowful end came, and she passed peacefully away.<br>
The remains were brought back to her home on Walnut street, where funeral services, conducted by Pastor Frank E. Weston, of the First Baptist church, assisted by Rev. B. S. Denny, Des Moines, who is here carrying on a special meeting in the Christian church, were held at the home on Sunday morning.<br>
The house was crowded by eh large number of sorrowing friends and neighbors who were in attendance.  The flowers were many and beautiful and silently attested the high regard in which Mrs. Short was held. A quartette, consisting of Mrs. Frank Tallman, Miss Pears Sprinkle and Messrs Conner and Sprinkle, sang favorite hymns.  The pall bearers were Messrs Fred Arnold, J. T. Chandler, C. Upton, Charles Winter, Fred Weaver and Leo Kauffman.  The Rebekah Lodge and Women's Relief Corps were both largely represented, the latter holding their burial service at the grave.  Interment was in Forest Home.<br>
Mrs. Zula Short will never be forgotten by her host of friends.  She was a woman with a great heart.  It was her nature to be kind and helpful.  Her smile brought pleasure to many a heart.  She shed the sunshine of her soul all about her.  Even sickness could not daunt her cheerfulness.  She was uncomplaining to the end.  The remembrance ofher will always be an inspiration to those who knew her, and many of her friends hope, through faith in Jesus Christ, to meet her again in glory, and to enjoy with her the felicities of eternal life.
