Anna May Byers<br>
Mrs. Anna May Misser Byers died suddenly at her country home last Wednesday, July 30.  She was born at Trumansburg, New York on May 9, 1871.  There she spent her childhood.  She came to Kansas in 1900 and was married to Hiram W. Byers, on September 19 of the same year.  They spent their married life on the farm near Hays.  She passed away at the age of 48 years, 2 months and 21 days.<br>
The funeral service was held in the Lutheran Church on Sunday morning at 11:30.  The large attendance indicated the esteem in which sister Byers was held.  Rev. Wiest conducted the service.  At the close theOdd Fellows had charge for a few minutes The Rebecca Lodge, of which the deceased was a faithful member, conducted the service at the grave.<br>
Sister Byers was a woman of many friends.  She was always ready to serve them when called upon.  Her neighbors and friends will sadly miss her.  We extend our deepest sympathy to the bereaved husband and to all who have sustained loss through her death.
