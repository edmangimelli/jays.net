Notes: <br> Salem News June 3,1920<br>
A regrettable accident occurred Saturday night in which Miss Ruth Spray had the misfortune to lose two of her front teeth.  She was walking along the street when she passed Earth Smith and Tom White, who were engaged in a heated argument.  Just as she passed the two, Smith staged a blow at White, as we understand it, and the latter dodged, Miss Spray getting the full force with the result stated.  After arrangements had been madeto take her to the dentist, the fight was resumed with no interference by the authorities.  The affair grew out of the war time feud, the immediate cause, we understand, being that Smith charges White with hogging the road whenever he meets him.
