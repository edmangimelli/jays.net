Notes: <br> [We have a spelling conflict here. John Hannah's obit and the Catherine J. Hannah obit lists the spelling as "Seton", yet all references for Catherine's father Ebenezer and children spell the name "Seaton". Not knowing which obits to believe I'll leave Catherine spelled differently from the rest of her family. -Jay Weston Hannah Nov 26 2005]<br>
