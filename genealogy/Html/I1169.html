GEORGE HARLAN PICKARD<br>
George Harlan Pickard, eldest son of Thomas and Katherine Pickard was born Dec. 25, 1862 on a farm south of Mt. Pleasant and lived all hislife in the immediate neighborhood except about two years in Old Pilot Grove.<br>
After a lingering illness of several months of patient suffering brought on by asthma, he quietly passed form this life to his Masterat 3:30 p.m. May 20, 1927, aged 64 years, 4 mon. and 26 days.<br>
He was married Nov. 26, 1885 to Jennie Hannah and to this union were born five children four of whom are still living, Myrtle as a child having preceded him in death.  He leaves to mourn their loss besideshis sorrowing widow, these four children - Katherine at home, Leslie at Stockport, and Owen and Dewey on nearby farms.  Besides these, one brother Lincoln, one half-brother Elwood and two half-sisters Kate and Sarah all of Salem; ten grandchildren, and innumerable relatives and friends.<br>
He was united to the M.E. church at Donaldson chapel on June 26, 1883 and unto this faith he kept until the last, still going to the same church and worshipping his God whenever he was able.<br>
He was a faithful and devoted husband and father, never ceasing inhis well doing and always interested in the betterment of conditions.  He will be sorely missed not only by his family but by the whole community as he was always ready to lend a helping and cheery hand wherever needed.  As our Creator has told us "For I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand.  I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge shall give me at that day, and not to me only but unto all them also that love His appearing. "<br>
And now knowing these comforting words we know that some day  if we will but look upward and unto our God we know that we shall meet with our loved and departed one in that place of constant rest where there isno darkness nor sorrowing, in that land of eternal sunshine.<br>
Funeral services were held at the Donaldson Methodist church Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock.  The services were in charge of Rev. Hankinsof Richland a former pastor of the Salem charge.  Interment in the east Salem cemetery.<br>
We wish to thank our friends for their help and sympathy duringour recent bereavement. - Mrs. Harlan Pickard and Family."
