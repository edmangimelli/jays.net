OBITUARY OF MRS. HOCKETT<br>
Abigil Jane Hockett, the subject of this notice, was born Feb. 10 th, 1844, near Richmond, Ind.  Her maiden name was Macy.  She came with her parents to Iowa in 1856, settling near Salem, in Henry count; was married to Nathan H. Hockett May 23d, 1867; died Oct. 31 st, 1899 at their home, near Salem, where they had lived for over 30 years.  She leaves besides her husband and three children, a large circle of relatives and friends to mourn her loss, but they sorrow not, as those who have no hope, for she died in the full assurance of a victorious faith in Jesus Christas her personal savior.  She was converted to Christ at the age of 19, and for several of the last years of her life was not only an active member of the church, but a firm believer in the doctrine, and a witness tothe experience of that perfect love, that casteth out fear; hence when she came down to the valley of the shadow of death she feared o evil, and during her most intense suffering she said, in the language of the poet:<br>
"Jesus can make a dying bed<br>
Soft as downy pillows are."<br>
In her experience God's promise of peace was wonderfully verified, Psalms 37-37;  Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace.  The funeral services were held at her home church at Oakland Mills, and in the presence of a large and truly sympathetic congregation.  She was laid to rest in the cemetery at that place to await the resurrection of the just.
