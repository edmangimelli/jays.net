CLINTON EUGENE SHAFER<br>
As the last day of the month of June was almost ready to dawn it witnessed the closing hours in the life of Clinton E. Shafer and his spirit winged its flight to the home above, not made with the hands eternal in the heavens.<br>
He was a son of Adam and Susanna Shafer and was born on the old home farm, southeast of Mt. Pleasant Feb. 1, 1859.  Every foot of that old place over which he loved to roam day by day was dear to his heart. He died unexpectedly at 3:30 on the morning of June 30, 1925.<br>
When he was about twenty years of age he and Miss Martha Seaton were united in marriage.  After only a few months of wedded life the death angel came and took away this dear companion and an infant child leaving a broken home.  October 15, 1882, he was joined in marriage to Jennie E. Hockett of Salem, Iowa, who remains to mourn the loss and departure of this precious companion.  Two children were born to their union.  Mrs. Ethel E. Saums, Mt. Pleasant, Iowa; and Mrs. Olive Leona Payne living near Mt. Pleasant on the old home place.  They together mourn the loss of a devoted father.  He was the first of his family to go leaving a heart broken circle and that con oly be reunited around the throne of God in heaven.  Three brothers and one sister also remain.  They are Mr. Ben Shafer, Sioux City, Iowa; Mr. Charles Shafer, Crawfordsville, Iowa; Mr. Grant Shafer living southeast of Mt. Pleasant, and Mrs. Esther McGavic of Mt. Pleasant.  Five grandchildren with may nieces and nephews also survive.  Six brothers and one sister preceded him in death.  These all carry a precious memory of his loving toil and self denial that he might thus show his love to others.<br>
"We loved him, -  no tongue can tell<br>
How much we loved him, nor how well.<br>
God loved him too, and thought it best<br>
To take him home to be at rest"<br>
Funeral services were held  on Thursday afternoon.  A short service was held at the home, 709 W. Madison St., after which the sorrowing company went to Pleasant Hill chapel in this old neighborhood.  The church was filled and scores stood outside owing to want of room within.  The casket was covered with beautiful flowers.  Mrs. Lot Abraham, Mrs. William Alden, Frank Wright and Frank Abraham, with Miss Bertha Wright  as accompanist, sang "Sometime We'll Understand." "That bright City", "When the Roll is Called Up Yonder", and "We'll Never Say Good Bye in Heaven". Pastor Frank Weston of the First Baptist church, Mt. Pleasant, assisted by Rev. A. L. Shuey, conducted the service.  He spoke from Amos 4:12. The pall bearers were Oscar Saums, Jessie Payne, Jim Reed and Ben, Charles, and Grant Shafer.  The Odd Fellow brethren , among whom he was much beloved, were present in large numbers.  They conducted the service at the graveside in Forest Home cemetery.<br>
Clinton Shafer was a man how had the respect and regard of all whoknew him.  He as a faithful, industrious, dependable, neighborly man, always ready to do a good turn to any who might need his help.  He will be greatly missed among a wide circle of friends.  His family have the deep sympathy of many.
