Death of Henry H Stark<br>
Henry H Stark, who was well known in Fairfield and Jefferson county, died at his home in this city Monday morning at 2 o'clock, after a protracted illness.  He was born in Park Co., Ind., February 6th 1839, where he grew to manhood.  He was married in that state April 22nd, 1860, to Miss Sarah E. Sappenfield, who survives him.  A short time later the young people removed to Jefferson county, and the home of the family has since been here.  Two children were born of this marriage, one of whom, Hiram Stark of Fairfield township, is yet living.  Mr Stark was an affectionate husband and father, and many friends will mourn his death and extend their sympathies to the bereaved wife.  Funeral services will be held at the family home this afternoon at 2 o'clock, and will be conducted by W.C.Shepherd.  The body will be interred in the city cemetery.--Fairfield Ledger 1-26-1898<br>
