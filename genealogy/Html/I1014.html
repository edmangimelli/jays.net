Notes: <br> Salem News Feb. 27, 1913<br>
MRS. WEEKS WRITES AGAIN<br>
ED NEWS:  - Since reading Levi Gregory's last letter I think I ought to say that "Jinny Bob" was John Taylor of Charleston, Ia.; that I lived by him as a neighbor, and that they were a nice family; the wife was confined to her bed for several years and he had a hard time.<br>
Mr. Gregory was right about the curtain factory but I am right on the other one, that is, the shop never was on the spot that the Weeks house stands on; it was near it.<br>
I think Mrs. McQuay's story was fine.  I will tell you how a parrot was lost and found south of Salem, the story was told me by Rachel Bunker. Her father was riding through the woods when he heard a voice say "Father! Father!" and looked all around to see if a child was lost. It repeated the words and he looked up, as it sounded above him, and there was the parrot.  He coaxed it to him and took it home with him, and there are those living that can tell you more about it than I can.  I hopethat Rachel Collins will tell how long it lived and some of its cute sayings.<br>
Yes, the News is alright and I for one like the present management better than any we ever had in Salem, and I think we ought to say the pleasant things before, not after people are dead.  I like the letters best of all in the News, except the locals.<br>
