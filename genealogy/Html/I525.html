RATGSDALE, Richard                  35                            240 11-10-1826<br>
<br>
<br>
The following information is from Terri Ragsdale, who wrote a book called " The Ancestral Heritage of Clarence Wilbur Ragsdale".<br>
<br>
"Our Richard was born about 1765 in St. James Parish, Lunenburg County,<br>
Virginia. (There was another Richard born the same time who I also did some<br>
research on. I wanted to make sure I was working on the right Richard!) This<br>
other Richard married a Susanna Allen, moved to Georgia, and was the son of<br>
Peter Ragsdale. It didn't take long to rule him out as being our Richard.<br>
<br>
Then I started tracing our Richard and his many moves. Richard married Rebecca<br>
Pollard in Nov. of 1785. (Surr. on this marriage was Wm. Burchett)<br>
Rebecca was born in Cumberland Parish, Lunenburg<br>
County, VA. Richard purchased a piece of land in Lunenburg County in 1791,<br>
which he later sold to his brother Drury in 1792. (Drury later sold this land<br>
himself and moved to Kentucky.) I believe Richard may have purchased this land<br>
with with an inheritance from his father, but this is not proven. This land was<br>
purchased from John Norris, Sr. and it ran alongside the "Burchett's" property<br>
line. Richard's sister, Ann, married a Burchett.(She married Young Burchett, brother of William who was surr. on marriage)<br>
<br>
Now, when Richard sold the land to his brother, Drury, it was interesting to<br>
note the people who signed the deed. Alexander Lester signed and he married<br>
Richard's sister, Mary. Elisha Pollard signed it and he was Rebecca's brother.<br>
Also a George Clarke signed it. He was the executor of Joseph Ragsdale's will.<br>
Joseph is Richard's father. Also, the description of the property was<br>
interesting. The description of the property lines in the deed are stated as<br>
follows:<br>
<br>
"Land lying in Lunenburg County on the Waters of Meherrin River, and containing<br>
one hundred and eighteen acres more or less, bounded as follows Vis, Beginning<br>
at Robert Scotts line, on a branch of Meherrin River thence along Scotts line to<br>
Henry Pollards line, thence along Pollard's line to E___ Burchetts line, thence<br>
along Burchetts line to George Clarks line; thence along Clarks line to the<br>
first station;"<br>
<br>
So here we have quite an interesting connection of people. We have now tied<br>
Richard's land in with Henry Pollard as well as George Clark. We have also tied<br>
in Robert Scott, who married Richard's sister, Jane Ragsdale. We also have<br>
Burchetts as neighbors who married Richard's sister, Ann.<br>
<br>
Now, in 1793 Richard and Rebecca moved to Madison County, KY. He is found on<br>
the tax lists between the years of 1793-1798. This is where my Drury was born.<br>
In 1799 Richard moved his family to Shelby County, KY where he purchased more<br>
land. Rebecca died between 1802-05 in Kentucky. In 1805 Richard married Martha<br>
McDowell.<br>
<br>
Like you, I found records on the Pollard's that shows Henry Pollard selling his<br>
property in 1793 and moving to Madison County, KY - the same time Richard and<br>
Rebecca moved. This was probably the land neighboring Richard's land in<br>
Lunenburg County, VA.<br>
<br>
Richard is found in the personal property tax books in Shelby County, KY between<br>
the years 1799-1801. The year 1802 was not legible. Henry County was formed<br>
from Shelby County in 1799 and Richard shows up in the Henry County personal<br>
property tax books between 1804-1823.<br>
<br>
The 1810 Henry County, KY census lists Richard as follows:<br>
3 Free While Males age 10-16<br>
1 Free White Male age 26-45<br>
2 Free White Females under age 10<br>
2 Free White Females age 10-16<br>
1 Free White Female age 26-45<br>
<br>
In 1824 a part of Henry County, KY becomes Oldham County and Richard shows up in<br>
those personal property tax books in 1824 and 1825. In 1826 Richard sold his<br>
land to Joseph Fible for $1,414 and moved to Indiana.<br>
