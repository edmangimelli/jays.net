Obituary<br>
GIBSON - At her father's home in Salem, Iowa, March 8, 1892.  Mary E. Gibson, aged 29 years and 9 months.  Burial at the Friend's Cemetery.<br>
The many friends of this estimable and saintly young lady would be saddened when they heard of her death, which occurred on the morningof March 8th.  She was the only daughter of Isaac T. and Anna M. Gibson, of Salem, Henry County.<br>
Mary Elma Gibson was born June 9, 1862 in the same room wherein she fell asleep in Jesus.  She had always enjoyed excellent health until about four years ago.  She was converted when about thirteen years of age, and has grown up as a consistent member of the Society of Friends. The life was beloved by all who knew her, because it was so beautiful, so pure and Christian like.  Her cultured refined, and graceful bearingin her daily walks of life, will be remembered by all with whom she came in contact.  That loving, beautiful life which had woven itself into noble womanhood at the age of thirty years, underneath the fostering care of loving parents, lays it down again without a murmur to Him who gave it and had redeemed it with His won blood when it had served the purpose for which it had been given.  She saw the wisdom of God's divine dealings, and acknowledged the infinite wisdom that had directed her uneven footsteps in the following language "If these walls could only speakthey could tell better than I of those long dreary days I have spent in solitude and darkness, yet I think it was the greatest blessing of my life when my sight was taken from me.  I did not think so then but Ido now.  Her life closed triumphantly with mind unimpaired, and a faith intensified by the near approach of scenes within the wall.  She passed the latter portion of her life preparing for the change that was gradually coming on apace.  She left behind her many testimonies and requests full of wonderful meaning and pathos.   She was more than willing to give up her life to Him who had redeemed the same for a higher, nobler sphere in the spiritual world beyond.<br>
The funeral services were conducted according to her own request by Rev. Davies, at the Friends church where a large sympathizing audience gathered to participate in the solemn and impressive service.  The Rev. Davies was followed by an address by Rev. W. G. Thorne, of Mt. Pleasant. His words were elevating and inspiring worthy the occasion, they could not fail to inspire the hope and strengthen those hearts that had been touched by this sore berevement.  Rev. Levi Gregory offered prayer.<br>
The remains were laid to rest almost underneath the shadow of the church she has been connected with from childhood.  Dear Mary, to thine immortal memory my pen would inscribe ovder thy tomb the language ofone,
