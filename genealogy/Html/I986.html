Notes: <br> Viola S. Courter and John W. Hannah were united in Holy Matrimony atan 8:00 P.M. ceremony on July 2, 1891 at the Methodist parsonage in Salem , Ia. by the Rev. Tomas S. Pool.  Reverend Pool's daughter played the organ and his young son, Robert D. who as blind played the violin.<br>
In 1897 they bought their first farm land which was located near the Hannah homestead.  Part of this farm was in timber.  There was no house, just a barn.  John W. with the help of his oldest brother , Frank, and the loving care of his wife, Viola, cut the trees and had them made into logs and cordwood for fuel.  From the logs they built a one-room log cabin.<br>
Everyone called Viola by the nickname of "Birdie".  Her mother had given Viola that name when she was a young girl because she was always singing, whistling, and imitating birds.  Viola loved nature.  ;Viola's father (Peter Courter) was the only one who called her Viola.<br>
John W. was always known as John W. or "Honest John".  His father's name was John.  John W. also had a nephew by the name of John R.  It was necessary to say "John W." so that others would know which John you were speaking about.<br>
John and Viola's only son, Harold, was born in the log cabin. . He lived only a few hours.  Birdie sewed a little white dress by hand to lay him away in.   He was buried under an arch of lilacs in the northeast corner in his grandfather Hannah's front yard.  Later two little blue -eyed girls were born in this log cabin.   One of these little girls, Belle, only weighed 2 1/2 pounds, mighty tiny and delicate.  Through faith and good care her parents, with the help of her 3 older sisters , raisedher through those very anxious days and months.  Esther Ruth was born ona cold Friday evening in February.  They were sure this one would be aboy, but five girls were mighty nice and precious.  A loft was built overone end of the log cabin where Reil, Bertha, and Mary slept.<br>
The girls climbed a ladder to the loft to get to their bed.  Belle and Esther slept in a cradle bed that rolled under their parents bed when not in use during the day.<br>
A landmark on the farm was a huge, tall, round rock located just a little way north of the log cabin.  It was large enough that five to six children could stand on it at one time.  The girls used to go down here with their dolls and play on the rock or play in the water by it.   The rock is still there.<br>
Several years later they bought another eighty acres to the west.  It had a nice house and other buildings on it.<br>
John W. and Birdie worked long hard hours together , clearing timberand milking ten cows.  Birdie churned butter and took ten one-gallon crocks of butter into Mt. Pleasant to sell every week along with eggs she sold for five to fifteen cents a dozen.  John W. cut trees, worked them up into cordwood, and delivered the wood nine miles into Mt. Pleasant to sell for fuel.<br>
In 1913 they sold the farm and bought a grocery and variety store in Morning Sun , Ia.  Here again they worked long hours side by side for 28 years in this business.  They also bought and sold butter, eggs, and tested cream from farmers.  Birdie had to have cataract surgery as she was going blind.  They sold the store and retired in 1941.<br>
Birdie was a member of G.A.R. and attended a National Convention in Ohio one year.<br>
There were times in their 59 years of life together when shadows veiled the days but with faith and prayer they made their way.<br>
