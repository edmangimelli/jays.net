Notes: <br> Obituary Parke County Indiana ca March 25, 1906 the researcher didn't give me an exact date or paper on this one.<br>
<br>
John Starks, after several years of patient suffering with rerumatism, quietly passed from the scenes of earth near Parkville, March 22, 1906.  He was born in Greene township on a farm just one-half mile west of the Mt Moriah Baptist Church, December 17, 1831, being 74 years, 3 months and 5 days old.  He was reared on the farm of his birth, and during early life enjoyed the comforts and privileges of other country boys.  Some of the noble characteristics of his life were, that of being quiet, reserved and unassuming, firm in his convictions of right, but never indulged in controversy, never meddled in the affairs of others. On December 17, 1857, the day he was 26 years old, he was married to Miss Elizabeth Connelly, who survives him.  To them were born four children, William, Alvah, Mrs Mary Livengood and Mrs Claude Ensey, all of whom are yet living and 11 grandchildren, also two brothers and a sister mourn their loss--Alex and James and Mrs Sarah Alexander, the latter living in Illinois.  For nearly two decades Mr Starks has been unable to do manual labor, almost the entire time being confined to his bed, sitting in his invalid chair and when his friends visited him he always greeted them with a cheerful smile and would talk intelligently of the current events of the day.  He indulged a grounded hope of heaven, was a believer in the doctrines as taught by the Predestinarian Baptists, but never identified himself with the church.  His last extreme sufferings were of short duration, and when the tragical hour came, the wife and children gathered around his couch with deep expressions of grief, and when it was seen that life was ebbing away the family united in calling for prayer, and during the short invocation the redeemed spirit of the dying man was wafted to its eternal home.<br>
The funeral services were held from the Mt Moriah church on Saturday, attended by a large concourse of relatives and friends, John Connelly of Hume, Ill., being present.  A H Dooley read the obituarysupplementing it with remarks on the patient life and character of the deceased, followed with an appropriate sermon by Elder C Airhart; when the casket was opened the last view of the lifeless features were taken by all present, then the remains were laid to rest in the cemetery near by to await the morning of eternity.<br>
