DEATH OF THOMAS SHORT.<br>
Another old settler, the last of a somewhat remarkable family, hasleft us.  Thomas Short, a resident of this country since 1849, a man possessed of many sterling qualities, died at his residence in Center Township, four and one-half miles southeast of town Friday evening, March 1, 1895, in the 73d year of his age.<br>
Thomas Short was born in Fairfield Co., Ohio, March 7, 1822.  He immigrated to this state in 1849.  He married Miss Mary Byers in this city April 28, 1864, and settled on a farm in Baltimore township.  In March 18 3 he moved to the farm in Center township where he has since resided and where he died.<br>
Mr. Short leaves his widow and two children to mourn his loss.  The older, John, lives at the home, the younger, Mrs. Ella Tabreck, whose home is in Idaho.  Both were present during the last three weeks of their father's illness.<br>
Thus has passed away a man highly respected and esteemed by all.
