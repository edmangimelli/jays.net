Jackson<br>
Lawrence Hunting and a little son, Robert met with a painful accident last Friday.  Mr. Hunting was mowing the weeds from the strawberry bed and sat down to gather a few berries, laying the scythe by his side. Robert ran up behind him and Mr. Hunting struck his arm on the scythe cutting it to the bone.  Little Robert stepped on it cutting his toes quite badly.  Mr. Hunting found it necessary to have the wounds dressed by a doctor.<br>
