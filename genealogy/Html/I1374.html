He lived here for a year and in 1880 went with James McIntosh to Colorado to work on a railroad.  Mr. Byers also worked in Colorado silver mines before coming back to Ellis county in 1892 to buy a farm northeast of Hays. Later, with his brother, John, he bought the farm which is now the Matthew Truan place and farmed there until in 1895 he purchased the farm he owned at the time of his death, twelve and a half miles northeastof Hays.<br>
Married in 1900<br>
Mr. Byers was married September of 1900 to Miss Anna Messer, a resident of New York state and the couple lived on the farm northeast of Hays until 1919 when Mrs. Byers died.  In the spring of 1920 he came to Hays to make his home with Mr. and Mrs. George Balls.<br>
