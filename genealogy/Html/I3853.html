OBITUARY OF AMOS HOCKETT<br>
From The Palinville, Kas., Gazette<br>
After a short illness of only one week one of Rook county's oldest inhabitants passed away.  Mr. Hockett was born in Indiana May 5, 1827, where he spent his early boyhood.  With his parents he moved to Iowain 1837, to the country known as the Black Hawk purchase.  April 27, 1848 he married Elizabeth Davis.  Of this union ten children were born, nine survive him, all of whom have families.  He leaves, besides wife and children a large number of grand and great grand children, most of whom reside in Rooks county.  He was converted when about forty years of age and joined the Friends church.  He was one among the first to break away from the old isms of the church and step out in the real liberty of the gospel.  In October 1878 he, with his entire family, came to Rooks county where he took up a claim which he lived on till his death. Through his earnest efforts there was a Sabbath school organized and soon church services were held.  He was very benevolent and seeing the need of a large building to gather the children for religious teaching he undertook the erection of a building and by his untiring efforts he Friends church was built, being the first church building in this part of Rooks county. The school, which he was the means of organizing, known all over the county as "Union Headlight," is still held and when he was able he was sure to be one of the number gathered there.  He has spent a long and useful life and will be missed by everybody as was shown by the long procession that followed his remains to the last resting place in Shiloh cemetery.
