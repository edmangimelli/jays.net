Notes from Jon Topp's files:<br>
Obituary indicates Nov 7, 1841 as birth date.  Listed as age 11 in the 1850 Census, taken 17 September 1850 in Iowa.  The Salem, Iowa Quaker meeting records list the birth date as 7 November 1841 in Henry Co, Iowa.  The census age appears to be inconsistent, requiring an 1838 or 1839 year of birth.  However, Elizabeth was not mentioned in the transfer from White River, Indiana to Salem, Iowa in November 1839. She was probably born in Iowa.  The Salem Quaker records and Obituary are given preference over the Census.  Moran's Bunker Genealogy gives November17, 1841.  No other corroberation for this date has been found.<br>

Funeral was held Wednesday at one o'clock and remains buried in the Brush Creek cemetery.  Rev. Porter of the Baptist church, conducting the service. The death of Grandma Shannon was a matter of regretful concern to all the residents of the little hamlet of Kennekuk.  She had lived there so long, was so much loved and respected that her passing, after two weeks sickness with pneumonia, was considered a town calamity.  It was Mrs. Shannon who was always one of the first on hand when there was sickness or distress in the neighboring families, and her tender ministrations were always appreciated and will live long in the memory of Kennekuk citizens.<br>
