PICKARD ACQUITTED<br>
After considering the case for several hours the jury returned a verdict of "not guilty' in the case of the state of Iowa vs. Dewey Pickard charged with "assault with intention to inflict great bodily injury" upon George Willis, the eight year old son of Mr. and Mrs. William Willis of Jackson township, while Pickard was teaching the Bushwack school and Willis was a pupil.<br>
The verdict was no surprise as the evidence failed to show that there was any attempt to injure the boy in the whipping that he received for stealing and lying.<br>
The evidence brought out was to the effect that the boy would refuse to recite and had sullen spells when he would not obey the teacher.  Mr. Pickard did the best he could and even consulted the parents but to no avail.  Finally several articles were missed by the other students and on March 2, 1920 some of them were found in the boy's desk and pockets and he later dug up others in the yard.  Pickard then whipped the boy, who confessed, remaining in school that afternoon.<br>
The boy reported the whipping and the parents finding his legs bruised had him examined by Mt. Pleasant doctors some neighbors also came in. The next day the bruises had turned dark and looked bad but no skin was broken or blood flowed.<br>
The whole question was as to whether the boy was shipped with too great severity.  The district is reported as bout evenly divided on the subject.<br>
The case was watched with much interest by school authorities as if Pickard were found guilty teachers would be afraid to use corporal punishment as they would run the risk of being arrested for assault,with a possibility of five years in the penitentiary.<br>
We note that John McMasters was on the jury.<br>
