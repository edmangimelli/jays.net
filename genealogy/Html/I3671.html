Notes: <br> The Salem Weekly News January 31, 1918<br>
EARL C. HUMPHREY<br>
Earl C. the oldest son of James T. and Gertrude Humphrey, was born near Salem September 4th, in the year 1891, and died in Deming, New Mexico after an illness of three weeks of pneumonia, January 2nd, 1918, aged 26 years, 3 months and 28 days.<br>
Earl grew to manhood in the community where he was born and the home of his parents, where he developed the noble principles of manhood and was everything in the home that parents could ask or expect of a son.<br>
He was a manly fellow- honest, industrious, brave and fearless, but tender and kind.  It was said of him that it was impossible to find anything in his life to cause anyone to dislike him, and when you met him he compelled admiration.<br>
In the summer of 1917 he responded cheerfully to the call of his country and entered the military service, where he gave up his life that our nation might be saved form the oppression of an unscrupulous tyrant.<br>
When the news of his serious illness came his father immediately went to him.  Everything that could be done was done for him, but no human power could save him and God took him.  He wanted to live, saying, "I have so much to live for, and I want to return and see all my friends in Iowa."<br>
The father tells in the highest terms of praise of the kind and generous treatment his son and he received at the hands of officers and comrades in the camp during the two weeks he was there.<br>
A very generous contribution was made  by his comrades with which to purchase flowers.  The remains were taken to the railway station by a military escort, while the accompanying band rendered inspiring and tenderest music.<br>
The name of Earl C. Humphrey will never be forgotten in the community where he lived, but will ever be green in the memory of all the people while the years roll on.<br>
His funeral was conducted from the Round Prairie Baptist church byRev. A .w. Miller, January 8th, at 11 a.m., in the presence of a very large congregation, where strong men and boys mingled their tears and sobswith those of tender women and girls.<br>
He is survived by his father, one brother Bert L. of Salem, and one sister, Anna C. Humphrey of Fairfield.<br>
His mother preceded him in death several years ago. - Contributed.
