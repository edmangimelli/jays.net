Robt. F. Hannah for Sheriff.<br>
Some of the neighbors of Robert F. Hannah of Jackson township havebeen asking him to come out for sheriff on the Democratic ticket.  Knowing Robert Hannah as well as we do, we can see why his neighbors are urging him to make the race.  He is a splendid democrat, would be well qualified and can be elected.  Of course ,we don't know what Sheriff Kauffman would say to this.  He has not said that he would run again, neither has he said that he would stand in the way of a worthy Democrat.  In fact, he said to this writer some time ago that he was not anxious to run forthe third term, especially if there was some good Democrat to run instead.<br>
All we can say is that if Robt. Hannah runs, we will have a splendid candidate and if Kauffman doesn't' run, we would be glad to do what little we can do to aid Hannah.  As we have said before Kauffman is a vote getter and if he wants to run for a third term we are not one to say that he shouldn't have the chance.  There is some prejudice against third terms in this county and it is a thing to be considered, however, Kauffman is a good politician, and he no doubt will give this careful consideration if he has not already done so.<br>
