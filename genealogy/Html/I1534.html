TRIBUTE TO J. M. ARMER<br>
The Des Moines Register of May 22nd, under caption of "Simple and Jovial Live Responsible for 93 Years,' and with photographs of Mr. and Mrs. Armer, contains the following tribute to our esteemed townsman:<br>
"James Armer, 93, attributes his longevity to the 'simple life' and friends add, 'a jovial one.'<br>
"He was born at Johnstown, Pa., March 29, 1832.  He took work on a canal boat as a drive of horses when 13 and at the end of four yearshad a record of never having been lashed by his master.  Apprenticed to a millwright he followed that trade many years.  Enroute to Iowa in 1864 he and his wife witnessed the battle of Paducah, Ky.<br>
"He has been farmer and justice of the peace. 'The only time I wasever arrested,' he says with a twinkle of the eye, 'was for trotting a team on the streets of Johnstown, which was contrary to the city ordinance.'Able to walk a few blocks and attend to his own business matters, 'Squire' Armer awaits the 'call of the evening bell.'"<br>

OBITUARY<br>
James McCurdy Armer was born near Johnston, Indiana Co., Penna., March 29, 1832, and passed away at his home in Salem, Ia., April 10, 1926,aged 94 years and 11 days.<br>
He was the son of Robert and Isabelle McCurdy Armer, and was one of a family of twelve children, only one now remaining, Mrs. Margaret Bower of Indianapolis, Ind.<br>
October 7, 1856 he was united in marriage to Maria Gamble of Johnstown, Pa., where they resided for seven years, then removing to Mt. Pleasant, Iowa in 1864, where they remained for eight years.<br>
Mr. Armer was a millwright and for a number of years followed this occupation, later he took up farming, purchased a farm in Jackson twp. where he with his family were residents for 35 years, following the retirement from which active farm life, Mr. and Mrs. Armer moved to Salem where the latter passed away April 10, 1923, preceding her husband to the great beyond, three years.  This seems a remarkable coincidence, husband and wife passing away on the same date, only a period of three short years, intervening.  James and Maria Armer enjoyed many of life's blessings, one of the greatest of these being that of traveling life's pathway together a period of more than 67 years.  In 1906 they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, and October 7th 1921, their 65th anniversary was passed quietly in their home with the members of their immediate family.<br>
To this union were born nine children - Bruce Armer, Salem, Ia.; Mrs. Mary Goldsmith, Salem; Mrs. Ellen Long, Salem; Miss Laura Armer, Salem; Mrs. Etta Harshbarger, Mt. Pleasant; four having passed to the great beyond, James Worth and Susan Francis passing away in infancy, George Armer in 1903, and Alda Armer Wright in 1921; a number of grandchildren and great grand children are also left to mourn.<br>
Mr. Armer was a man loved and respected by all who knew him, was a great reader and real student of nature and history, and his wonderful memory enabled him to retain much; he was an earnest christian and church worker, was a member of the Methodist church for over 50 years, one of his favorite church papers being the Christian Advocate of which he had been a continual subscriber for 50 years; he was a true friend and neighbor, and when we think of his long useful life, covering a period of more than fourscore years and ten, we think of it as an example, typifying real truth and honor, and it may be truthfully said, "I have fought the good fight, I kept the faith,  I have finished my course, enter now into the joy of thy Lord."<br>
Funeral services were conducted Monday, April 12 at 2:30, from the Methodist church in Salem, by Rev. Thomas Pool, a former pastor and life-long friend of the deceased, assisted by Rev. F. A. Wilder and Rev. Bishop.  A quartet, namely, Miss Helen McMasters, Mrs. Albert Harshbarger, Mr. Leon Smith and Mr. Herbert Garretson, sang beautifully "Rock of Ages," "Nearer Still Nearer" and 'No Night There."  Mrs. Herbert Garretson, piano accompanist.  The pallbearers were, L. C. Trueblood, John McMasters, Alva Van Trump, Jay Long, Raymond Trueblood and Thomas Stafford.  The remains were interred in the family lot in the M. E. cemetery.
