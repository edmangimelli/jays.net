Salem News 10-15-1896<br>
Died, at 8 a.m. , Sunday, the 111th inst. Miss Ina Scarborough, at the residence of her father about four miles east of this city, of consumption, after a prolonged illness.  Ina was the beloved and esteemed daughter of Mr. George Scarborough of Jackson township.  At the timeof her death she was 16 years of age.  She succumbed meekly to the callof her Father.  About midnight she summoned the family and requested her sister to sing for her.  That she was very happy and desired to leave this world before the dawn of day so she could join her mother on the other shore were enthusiastic expressions of hers.  Her mother died about five years ago, after which Ina, with her sisters, strove to fill the vacant place and comfort their dear father by assuming full charge of the household cares.  They met with splendid success in this and received many words of praise.  Deceased is one of twins and has been a patient sufferer for several years and her death had been expected several times before, but she rallied to cheer the home a while longer.<br>
She was a good daughter and a model sister and her loss will be deeply felt.  Hosts of friends greatly lament her death.  She is survived by her father, twin sister and a younger sister.  Mr. Scarborough deserves the sympathy of all in this, his sad bereavement.  The funeral occurred Monday afternoon at 1 oclock from the residence, Rev. Hogie officiating, and the remains were interred in the Friends  cemetery.<br>
