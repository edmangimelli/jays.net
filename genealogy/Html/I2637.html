OBITUARY<br>
Henry Scarborough, a son of Lewis and Sarah Scarborough, was born at Lowell, Henry county, Iowa, August 26, 1872, and died Feb. 15, 1901 at the home of his aunt, Mrs. Charity McVey.  Mr. Scarborough was a bright young man who sought for good society with which to mingle.  Some years ago he became a member of the Odd Fellows Lodge in Illinois, and when he came into the vicinity of Salem, sick , it was soon known by the Odd Fellows lodge here.  And surely the lodge of Salem have acted the part of the good Samaritan to their Brother though he was not a member of the lodge here.  For they went and searched him out and visited him fromtime to time, and ministered very tenderly to his needs and assisted in giving him a respectable, and beautiful burial.<br>
Mr. Scarborough was a believer in christianity and the church, but not until his last sickness did he give himself up to God, and take Christ as his savior from sin, and with him in heaven and we on earth, we rejoice together over his glorious victory over sin and Satan.  For we believe that he has gone home to heaven to be forever with the Lord.<br>

We wish to express our thanks to the friends, and Odd Fellows lodge,who so kindly assisted us during the sickness and death of our brother, Henry.  We also thank the choir for their excellent music.<br>
Mr. and Mrs. J.L. Scarborough, New London, Ia.
