CHARLES M. TRUEBLOOD<br>
The funeral services for Charles M. Trueblood held in the cedar Friends church, northwest of Salem Wednesday afternoon, were attended by a large number of friends of he community and also from Salem.  Rev. Mrs. Bessie F. Collins conducted the devotionals and the services were conductedby Frank Conover, pastor of the Cedar Creek church.  The songs, "The Eastern Gate," "No Disappointment in Heaven," and "Beulah Land" were sung byMrs. John Brown, Mr. and Mrs. Howard Brown, Harry Cooper and accompanied at the piano by Mrs. Harry Cooper.<br>
Charles Matthew Trueblood, only child of William D. and Lydia Maxwell Trueblood, was born Dec. 27, 1869 and passed through death's portalsinto God's other room February 14, 1938, age 68 years, 1 month and 18 days.<br>
It is of peculiar interest to note that his coronation day came onthe same day as that of his father, who died February 4, 1929, his mother having preceded them in November 1920.  As a babe he opened his eyeson the beauties of this world on the farm now occupied by J. R. Savage,one mile south of Cedar Creek church.  Later he went with his parents tothe present homestead where he lived a useful and exemplary life for 68 consecutive years.<br>
On December 12, 1900, he was united in marriage with Minnie Bogue and to this union were born two children, Verle and Lois, to whom he hasever been a faithful husband and loving father.<br>
He was converted in early life and as a young man he was actively interested in the Christian Endeavor society of which he was a charter member.  Throughout life, he retained his birthright membership in the Cedar Creek Friends church, in which church he served as treasurer for 30 years.  He was a successful business man, highly esteemed by his business associates.  He ahs filled many places of trust in both church and community and has ever been found faithful and worthy of confidence placed in him by his friends and neighbors. Patience was one of his finest characteristics and perhaps nowhere was this revealed so muchas in his last days of suffering when he gave humble obedience to the nurse's suggestions and tender ministrations of his devoted loved ones.<br>
He is survived by his faithful wife, his son Verle B. Trueblood of Waterloo, his daughter, Mrs. Lois Hallowell and two grandchildren, Keith and Zelda Mary Hallowell of the Cedar Creek community and a host of relatives and friends mourn the loss of this quiet kindly an, who inhis unassuming way sensed a situation and lent a helping hand to all.<br>
Interment was made in the Cedar Creek Friends cemetery and the pall bearers were Elbert Brown, Hale Brown, Enos Brown, Glen Maxwell, Ross Maxwell and Ed Breazeale
