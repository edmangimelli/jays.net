Notes: <br> From Unknown Newspaper - clipping<br>
Mrs. S. F. Donaldson<br>
Katie Ann Bunker, the eldest daughter of Jonathan and Julia Collins Bunker, was born in the Donaldson Chapel vicinity in Henry County, Iowa, Feb 22, 1868 and passed from this life at her home near Salem, Ia. about 11:00 p.m. Jan. 23, 1929.  At the time of her death she was 60 years, 11 mon. and one day old.<br>
She was left motherless when eight years old and her father, a Civil war veteran who went through the entire war, preceded her in death while she was yet a young woman.  She accepted the christian faith at Donaldson chapel at the age of 18 years and continued a steadfast and loyal christian until her death.  She was united in marriage to Samuel F. Donaldson, Dec. 31, 1890.  To this union six children were born.<br>
She spend her entire life in the Donaldson chapel and Salem communities.  Even as a child her kind, thoughtful, and friendly manner made her at once a favorite among her acquaintances and friends.  This same lovely disposition continued to be more evident in her life as the years seemed to add sweetness and loveliness to the beauty of her tender and kindly manner.  In the ever widening circle of friends of her neighborhood, her church, her relatives and others she became a golden link.  In all of life's many responsibilities she gladly accepted her share of eh hardships, and sacrifices, where that was necessary, to add to the comfort and happiness of others.<br>
In her passing, earth has lost a loyal and loving companion and mother, a faithful grandmother and friend, a thoughtful, kindly neighbor andall these qualities sweetened by a noble and child-like faith in God, Heaven has gained a saintly soul who will not be a stranger where there is love and joy among the elect of God.  She has gone to her final triumphant coronation.  No more shall sorrow and earth's burdens sadden her heart, yet we are sure that she would have gladly postponed the time of her glorification if by continuing in this sin-scarred world she could have been more helpful to her loved ones.  It is unthinkable that, that spirit which did so much for our happiness here will be less concerned in us in eternity.   But in moments, that we think not, her lovely soul will be in some manner urging us to be strong and continue the good fight untilour final triumph.<br>
In her sudden death she is mourned by her husband, Samuel F. Donaldson, her six children, Forrest, Mrs. Hazel Stone, and Mrs. Ada Cox of Salem, Ia.; Mrs. Fae Kerr, Burlington, Ia.; Gerald, Mt. Pleasant, Ia.; and Mrs. Ruth Thomson, Clinton, Ia.; one sister, Mrs. Julia Brennan, Vona, Col.; two brothers, George Bunker who lives on the old homestead, and James Bunker, Andover, Kas.; one half sister, Mrs. Mattie Parson of Arkansas City, Kas.; ten grandchildren and many many friends.  A sister, Laura, died in infancy and Robert Bunker a half brother, also preceded  herin death.<br>
Her death was so unexpected that only her husband, Samuel F. Donaldson and her daughter Mrs. frank Stone and husband were at her bedside.<br>
The funeral services were conducted from the Salem Methodist church at 11:00 a. m. Jan. 26, 1929.  The Rev. R. L. Brown, pastor of the church, had charge of the services and used as his theme, "The Question of the Ages." taking as his text Job 14:14: "If a man dies shall he live live again?"   He pointed out that in every age this question has been asked; that both nature and revelation gave conclusive proof of an affirmative answer.  A mixed quartet composed of Mr. and Mrs. Leon Smith, Mrs. Ax Baritone and Mr. Flayed Byres sang three appropriate songs.  The pallbearers were her neighbors, Messrs. walker Montgomery, Wayne Ross, Will Moyle, Frank Moyle, Russell Nicholson and Milo Thompson.
