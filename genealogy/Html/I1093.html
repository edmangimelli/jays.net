Notes: <br> Mt. Pleasant Free Press  June 18, 1891<br>
- The Free Press office on Tuesday enjoyed a pleasant call from Mr. J. N. Grubb and Mr. Perry Byers, of Salem township.  These gentlemen brought in specimens of the cheese manufactured by them, which we have tested, and pronounce first class in every respect.- Their cheese is made in convenient size for general family use, and is of most excellent quality. Also they proved to us that potatoes in this most favored country, cannot long remain a scarce article of diet.  They are to be attendant this year.  The specimens shown us of their own growth are of large size and almost fully matured.<br>

At the early age of ten years, he together with his parents came to Henry county, Iowa, settling on a farm east of Salem where he remained the greater portion of his life.<br>

He had been in failing health for over three years, during which time he has shown great patience and fortitude, which were two of the stronger elements of his nature.<br>
Mr. Byers was not a member of any church, but gave of his help andlove to all.  He was a man of great moral character, strong in his sense of justice and in his stand for the right.  There will be a great vacancy not only in the home around which his interests  were centered, but in the community and in the lives of the children for whom his smile of greeting was always ready as they passed his home daily on their wayto and from school.<br>
He leaves to mourn their loss, the faithful wife, from whom during their 55 years of  married life he had scarcely been separated, eleven children, thirty-seven grandchildren and three great-grand children. One brother Hiram Byers of Hays, Kas. and hosts of relatives and friends.<br>
Funeral services were held from the M.E. church of Salem, conducted by Rev. F.E. Weston of Mt. Pleasant assisted by the pastor Rev. F.A. Wilder.  Three songs, "Rock of Ages," "Meet Me There,"  "It is Well With My Soul", were sung by a mixed quartette composed of Miss Helen McMasters, Mrs. Elsie Harshbarger, Messrs Herbert Garretson, Leon Smith.
