Notes: <br> Salem News August 3, 1916<br>
Harold, the little three- year - old son of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Harshbarger met with a painful and what might have been a serious accident Sunday evening.  He was standing by his mother while pumping water for the horses which got to fighting and threw Mrs. Harshbarger and Harold down, running over and tramping on the little boy's foot, cutting it quite badly and bruising him all over.  His many friends hope he may soon recover as he is a general favorite.<br>
