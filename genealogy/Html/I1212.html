JOSEPH A. SHANNON<br>
Joseph Archibald Shannon, who died at his home in Kennekuk at 8 o'clock on Saturday, Feb. 19, at the age of 76 years 1 month and 26 days, was born in New Albany, Ind. , Dec. 24, 1839. When still a young man he moved with his parents to Henry county, Iowa, where on Nov. 26, 1863, he was married to Elizabeth Bunker, of Lowell, Ia.  To his union eight children were born, three dying in infancy.  His wife died Dec. 26, 1910.  Two daughters also died in 1912 - Mrs. Mary Emaline Root on Jan 31, and Mrs .Ella Anna Meek on June 21.  He is survived by three sons- George and Edgar, of Kennekuk, and William Shannon of Horton, and by four grandchildren, one great-grandchild.<br>
Mr. Shannon came to Kansas overland in the fall of 1870 and ever since then has made his home in Grasshopper township, Atchison county. He was a resident of Kennekuk for over 30 years.  The past two years hehad been making his home with his son George and wife.  Mr. Shannon was a man well thought of by all who knew him; he was kind to both man and beast. it seems as though he had more than his share of grief in the past five years, losing his wife, two daughters and several brothers and sisters. He will surely be missed in this community and his loss can never be replaced.  The sympathy of the entire community go forth to the surviving members in their great time of grief.<br>
The funeral was held on Monday at Kennekuk. - The Horton (Kansas) Headlight Commercial.
