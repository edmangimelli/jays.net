WILLIAM K. BUNKER<br>
The many friends and relatives of William K. Bunker were saddened to learn of his death which occurred at his home in Salem on May 2nd, 1932 at the age of 81 years, 6 mon. and 22 days.<br>
William K. Bunker was the son of Robert and Myra Dillingham Bunker and was born in Salem, Iowa, October 8th, 1850.  He spent almost his entire life in and around Salem, with the exception of a few months spent in Kansas.  He was one of a family of nine children, one brother and seven sisters, all preceding him in death except one sister, Mrs. Rachel Collins of Salem.<br>
He  was united in marriage to Rosella Canady, Sept. 25, 1873.  To this union were given seven children, three girls and four boys, one girl preceding in death; the other six children and nine grandchildren with their mother survive. The children are: Clarence, Albert, Florence, Clyde and Elsie, all of Salem and Charles of Stockport.  All were with himand ministered to him in his last sickness.<br>
He will be greatly missed in the home and community.  His going leaves in the hearts of those who remain an aching void not easily filled, but the influence of his life in the home and elsewhere will abide.<br>
Mr. Bunker being a pioneer of early days necessitated a continuation of the hard times that old settlers had to undergo but the frontier life did not discourage his spirits but built character.  He was of Quaker parentage and later joined the Donaldson chapel church then again changed his membership to the M. E. chruch of Salem, where he attended and helped.<br>
The funeral services were held on Wednesday afternoon, May 4th at the Methodist church and were conducted by Rev. J. W. Stine of Burlington, a personal friend and former pastor, assisted by Rev. G. C. Pennington, the local pastor.<br>
The large assemblage of relatives and friends and the abundance of beautiful flowers were as a tribute to the one who had departed and also an expression of sympathy to those who survive.<br>
Rev. Stine  used for his text, Rev. 21-4, "The former things are passed away," and the songs, "Jesus Lover of My Soul" and "Above the Bright Blue," were beautifully sung by Mr. and Mrs. Leon Smith with Mrs. Floyd Beery presiding at the piano.  Following the services the remains were laid to rest n the South cemetery wit the four sons and two sons-in-law the pallbearers.  These were Clarence Bunker, Albert Bunker, Charles Bunker, Clyde Bunker, Greely Frary and Albert Harshbarger, while six personal friends of the deceased were the honorary pallbearers and these were J. T. Ingrim, J. W. Foss, Eli Brown, Levi Parkins, Dora Powell and Mahlon Packer.
