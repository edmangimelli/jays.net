The Hawk Eye<br>
COLUMBUS JUNCTION -- The driver of a car was killed Saturday after he was thrown from his car after it left the road three miles northwest of Columbus Junction.<br>
Timothy L. Farrier, 22, Columbus Junction, was southbound on Louisa County Road X-17 about 5 a.m. when he lost control on a curve and went into a ditch.<br>
The Iowa State Patrol said Farrier's car struck a driveway and became airborne. When it landed, the car rolled and came to a stop on its top.<br>
Farrier and a passenger in the car, Eric E. Farrier, 20, Columbus Junction, were thrown from the car. Neither man was wearing a seat belt and the state police's report said it was unknown if it would have made a difference.<br>
Eric Farrier was taken to University of Iowa Hospitals. An official there late Saturday evening said the family was not releasing any information about his condition.<br>
The state patrol did not indicate whether alcohol was involved in the crash.<br>
