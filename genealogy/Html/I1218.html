There's a lone little grave on the hillside<br>
O'er which has no blossom yet blown;<br>
Upon it the first snow is falling<br>
And around it the winter winds moan.<br>
There's a dear little chair by the fire side<br>
That vacant will be evermore.<br>
There's a box laid aside full of playthings,<br>
That will never more litter the floor.<br>
<br>
There's one more little angel in heaven.-<br>
( How selfish I am to complain!)<br>
I have one little lamb safely folded<br>
Away from earth's sorrow and pain.<br>
Oh, heart that is empty, and aching<br>
For the little one under the sod,<br>
Held fast to these sweet words of comfort,<br>
"Of such is the Kingdom of God."<br>
