GEORGE EARNEST ARMER<br>
George Earnest Armer was born on the 3rd day of July, 1874, makinghim 28 years, 8 months, and 26 days old, he having died on April 30th at 11:35 o'clock.<br>
He was always a good son and brother, and he will long be mourned for he was always a good friend and neighbor to all in sickness or trouble. He was always ready to give a helping hand to every one and so he will be greatly missed by all his sorrowing family and friends.  He said he would soon be at home, he would soon be in heaven with the angels and he wanted to meet all of his loved ones and friends over there and said to tell them all good-bye for him.<br>
Funeral services were held at Donaldson chapel Saturday at 10:30 a.m., conducted by the pastor, Rev. J. A . Sinclair, and the remains were interred in the M. E. cemetery at Salem.<br>
Had He asked us, well we know<br>
We would say, "O spare the blow,"<br>
Yes with streaming tears should pray<br>
<br>
"Lord we love him, let him stay."<br>
In love he lived, in peace he died,<br>
His life was asked, but God denied.
