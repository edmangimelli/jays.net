------<br>
Former Mt. Pleasant Man Dropped<br>
Dead Monday Morning While<br>
Working on Street Car<br>
Track in Ottumwa<br>
------<br>
The body of Mr. William Boyles of Ottumwa, who died suddenly there Friday morning was not brought to this city, his former home, for intermentas was first expected.  The funeral service was held in Ottumwa Sunday afternoon at 3:30, and interment was there.<br>
A special invitation, however, was extended by members of the family to all friends here to attend and especially the members of the I.O.O.F. lodges and Rebekah lodge of which Mr. Boyles was a member.  Mr. William Shannon, father-in-law of the deceased, and his wife; also Mr. Owen Hourihan, a brother-in-law, were in attendance from Mt. Pleasant.  Mrs. Mattie Cobb, of Aurora, a sister of Mrs. Boyles, was also expected to be present at the funeral.<br>
The Ottumwa Courier of Friday evening contained the following account of the sudden death of Mr. Boyles.<br>
---o---<br>
"While greasing the curve of the street railway tracks at the corner of Ward and Keota streets this morning William Boyles, aged 49, residing at 309 Park avenue, a veteran employee of the company, dropped dead.  It is thought that his death was caused by heart failure although he had never suffered from the disease.  In fact Mr. Boyles had not been ill since a mere boy.  His death occurred about 8:45 o'clock and Marion Smith, a rural mail carrier, and Lawrence Moss were the first to reach the dead man.  An examination by physicians revealed the fact that life was extinct, although the body was still warm.  The remains were removedto t he office of the street car company where physicians again made an examination.<br>
Wife Becomes Hysterical.<br>
Mrs. Boyles was immediately communicated with and when she arrivedat he office and saw the remains of her husband, she immediately became hysterical.  Frantic cries to him to come back to life touched the hearts of all who heard them.  For a time the bereaved woman would not allow the physicians to touch the body.  The remains were later removed to theC. T. Sullivan morgue and prepared for burial.  Coroner A. W. Slaught was summoned.  He will hold an inquest tonight at 7 o'clock at which time an effort will be made to learn the cause of death.<br>
Mr. Boyles had greased one side of the curve and was starting to work on the other track.  The Ward street car passed while he was at workand he waved his hand at the motorman and conductor.  When the car got two blocks away, the men on the rear platform saw Mr. Boyles throw up his hands and fall backward to the ground.  Smith and Moss rushed to his assistance but death had been instantaneous.<br>
Was Veteran Employee.<br>
The deceased was a veteran employee of the Ottumwa Railway & Light company, having been in their employ for nine years.  He had the care of the tracks.  He was a familiar figure to men who never knew him by any other name than "Bill."  He always called the cars on circus and on base ball days and his long connection with the company made him well known to hundreds of Ottumwans.  He was of a good disposition and numbered his friends by the legion.  The news of his death came as a great shock to his co-workers and to his numerous friends.<br>
Worked for Burlington.<br>
The deceased formerly resided at Mt. Pleasant and had a host of friends and relatives  there. For many years he was baggage man for the Burlington at the Ottumwa station and he also worked in other capacities for the railroad.  He is survived by his wife and one daughter, Miss Gladys Boyles.  Following his sudden death this morning, the report was circulated about the city that he had been electrocuted but this report was denied by the company officials who inspected the  tracks at the scene of his death.  It is the general belief that heart failure caused his death.
