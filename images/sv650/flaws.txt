Shane walked me around the bike today. This are all the flaws:

- Exhaust can (muffler) perfect. 
- Foot brake level - end is snapped off, rebent. Should replace.
- Right mirror dirty, but perfect.
- Left mirror, scratches on black plastic.
- Headlight perfect (maybe slight scratch on chrome).
- Need left clutch lever. ($7) Shane said he'd fix.
- Need after-market left directional ($15 for the set).
- Dent is about the size of a handgrip on left size of tank.
- Left shifter, very end is broken. (redrill, replace? or buy for $40ish?)
- Gagues: tach chrome is damaged. Plastic damaged "on white part."
- Grab rail is gone, black piece directly behind the seat. Looks
  like it was removed, not torn off.
- Some sort of after-market fender-eliminator kit on it.
- 5587 miles.
- Handlebars are real cheap, should be replaced.

(Looks like it was wheelied over backwards...)
(It came from Pennsylvania...)


Sounds pretty easily fixable, doesn't it?

Thanks,

In an ideal world, one of the luxuries of a luxury hotel would be an easier way to earn airline miles.
