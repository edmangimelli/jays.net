<h2>jays.net 1st Occasional "Who's Shiite is This, Anyway?" Auction</h2>
<h3>aka "Name [the owner of] That Shiite"</h3>

Items on the Auction Block (roughly counter clockwise from top), 
and their official item numbers.

<ol type="i">
<li>Blue, black, and yellow Columbia Sportswear Company wind breaker. Size XL.
<li>(Soccer |Foot)ball. There's another one in my front closet w/ blue
emblemy junk (not pictured here).
<li>Pink and blue packet of Cellophane Noodles carbon dated to 1995.
<li>Full size George Foreman grill & accessories.
<li>Brown shoes.
<li>Styrofoam cup, lid, and straw labelled "GIANT 32 ounce." Approximately
2/3 full of a brown non-carbonated fluid w/ floaty things on top. Fluid tastes
vaguely like watered-down "Dr. Pepper."
<li>More brown shoes.
<li>Erinem... err... Eminem cassette tape.
<li>Funky Indian sitar album in psychodelic colors. Labelled "Six Speed 
Universe - Soul Mandala" on the back. The front is all Indian jibberish.
<li>Black Nike flip-flops. Dangling filth all over them tastes vaguely like
years of dust from my garage.
<li>"Hotpot". Posterior metal surface does, indeed, increase in temperature 
when electrical current is applied to the power cord, but no drugs found.
<li>Small Mason jar w/ label "Lemon Juice". Contents do taste vaguely like the
juice of the "lemon" citrus fruit.
<li>Blue sheet. No detectable stainage.
<li>Plastic jug. Filled with a clear, odorless gas.
<li>Even more brown shoes.
<li>Robert the Robot. Has a business card on it, referring to a "Herald 
Publishing House," but the Missouri address listed no longer exists.
<li>Bonus item: Steel spring-loaded mole trap. I think my neighbor who moved
away a year ago left this in my backyard. I can't remember for sure though.
</ol>

<h3>About the Auction</h3>

All this junk has been left at my house over the years by God knows who.
So, I decided to sell it off to the highest bidder. If you see stuff you like,
you can send me money (err... bid) by clicking the link below.

<p>
(Ok, ok. I <i>do</i> know where <i>some</i> of these items came from.
Dad, I'm not selling your robot, I'm just bored on a Sunday afternoon.
-grin- The rest probably belong to Üter or B.R.A.D....?)
