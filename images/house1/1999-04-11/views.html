The view out my future front door looking NW down the hill and up the hill
to the NE.<p>

The view out my back yard, and a neighbor on the corner. Yes, there is
a lot between us where another house will <i>squeeze</i> in someday.
My "extended back yard" should stay that way -- it's a designated
green space of the developer (for now?).

If you walk straight out my front door and turn left (west), you can
see down into the valley...

And if you walk down the street to that intersection you can look south
and northwest over some scenic Nebraskian landscape (that isn't nearly
as cool in these photos).
