Here's my truck (and me)
parked in my garage and looking suave. If anybody has weather-proof stuff
they want stored, let me know <i>-grin-</i>.
The photo in the bottom right is a camera in the SE corner of
my lot watching me peer in my front window and pushing my doorbell.
I locked my keys in the house <b>again</b>. <i>-sigh-</i>
