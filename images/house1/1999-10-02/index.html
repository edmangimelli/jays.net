The drywall's complete.<a href=#footnote1><sup>[1]</sup></a>
Some paint, cabinetry, flooring, sinks and I'm 
all set. Oops. I need my fireplace hearth too.<br>

<p>Yay! Four holes! Aren't those cool? I told the sales guy to tell the 
carpenter to only worry about three, but they turned out great after all!

<p>The view out the back porch. ... Back porch?? Hey! I've got a back

<p>What a weird set of drywalling that is! This covers up the

<p>It looks like they've decided to re-dig my moat in the front lawn
now. What's up with that?<br>
<img src=mvc-024f.jpg>
<p>Oooo!! A deck! Told you I had a deck!<br>

<p>The neighborhood is really flushing out! 7 new houses are springing
up around my lot, with more to come (I'm sure). Why is it that it seems
that other houses are going up so much faster?...
