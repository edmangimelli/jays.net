And 2.5 hours later (yes, I know I'm not done yet):<br>

I was actually shooting for a color lighter than the stain on the middle
railing, but ended up mostly with a near-red brown as shown on the bottom.
I don't know if that's a factor of the greying from being untreated for 9
months or what... While I think it's all the same kind of wood, some of
it is very rough -- and turned very dark, while some of it is very
smooth, ending up much lighter.<br>

The sample in the store gave me the impression that this would be slightly
darker than a simple "wet" look. At the rate it actually colored, I think
I would have been perfectly happy w/ the cans marked "clear." Doesn't
look like "white cedar" to me.

Anyhoo, I did buy some furniture for downstairs a couple months back. BRAD
has converted the sofa into a surprisingly wide bed (wider than a single 
matress, I'd wager) by removing the oh-so-fluffy pillows.
