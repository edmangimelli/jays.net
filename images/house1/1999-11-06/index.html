Paint! Wow, that's the whitest freaking house I've ever seen... It'll
get a little saner once the trim color has been applied (I hope). 
Looks good from the front though.<br>

The sod lines out in these strip developments are pretty comical. 
I don't know if they're going to try to lay my sod this fall or not.
My front and rear lawns have been scraped for the sod now though.<br>

From the entryway... You can barely see the linoleum here. Next
comes the carpet in the great room, all the upstairs rooms, and
downstairs. I also need the tile around the fireplace and the hearth.<br>

The kitchen... You can sort of see the linoleum. The 
countertops look great, but you can't really see those here.<br>

The master bathroom with my intentionally objectionable flooring
and black marble-esque streaks in the sink.<br>

Miscellaneous shots of the freshly stained trim. Look at all that
closet space I'll never use!<br>

All my lighting and fans in a nice pile downstairs.<br>
