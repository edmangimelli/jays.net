<h3>Suggested Routes</h3>

<img src="2_routes.gif"><br>
<b>[Route 1]</b> If you're arriving 
from the north, once you're on 680 west/south take the 72nd Street exit 
south to State Street. State is your second possible right turn. It doesn't
look like much and there's no big sign so don't miss it. Follow State
for a mile or so until it dead ends on Wenninghoff Road. Turn left (south)
and Hanover Street is your first left turn.<p>
<b>[Route 2]</b> If you're arriving from the south, exit 680 north/east 
at Irvington Road (aka Highway 133, exit 6). Turn right (east) for 1.4
miles until you hit Crown Point Avenue. Turn left on Crown Point Avenue
and then <b>immediately</b> turn left again onto Wenninghoff Road. There's
a John Kraft Chevrolet on this corner. You should now be going north
on Wenninghoff Road for 1.2 miles until you hit Hanover street. There's 
a big "Somerset" housing development sign / banners / flags on this corner.
<p>

<b>[All Routes]</b> Congrats, you're darn close now. Stay on Hanover until
it dead ends at the top of the hill and turn left on 83rd Street. Potter
street is your first right, and my house is the third lot (second house 
(at the time I wrote this)) on the right. <p>
Welcome to my humble abode!<p>
