<b>Wiring</b><p>

Standing in the entryway looking up to the bedrooms
you can see some of the many 
arrays of wiring strung all over the house. The white cables are 
mostly power -- tt's amazing what you can learn poking around in a 
half-built house...<br>

<p>The vertical rectangles you may or not be able to make out here
are supposed to be a series of four cosmetic holes in the main support
wall. The electricians apparently weren't aware of the plan, since the
holes will now have to move upwards to avoid the power lines run 
straight through the original structure.<br>

<p>Jay's Wiring Weekend Extravaganza(tm) was not the collosal project
originally envisioned since I ran out of time, work threatened to suck
up my weekend, and the cabling company who was running my cable
TV lines offered to run extra lines. I accepted that offer, and hired 
them to install 11 co-ax, 11 cat-5 and 11 cat-3 cables in strategic
locations throughout the house.<p>
A full 2 co-ax, 2 cat-5, 2 cat-3 outlet set looks like this: (this set
is in the master bedroom):<br>

<p>With all of that hired out, we (Frank, Eli and I) were left to cope 
with only the installation of surround sound upstairs in "the great 
room." The project involved stringing three front wires (left, center, right)
and two rear. 
<p>
Here you see the three front cables running through 3 masterfully drilled
holes in the NW corner. The wire looped back on itself is lightly 
stapled (with neato round staples from my new neato staple gun) since 
I'll need to punch a hole in the drywall for later retrieval of this short
lead to the left speaker.

<p>
Here's where all the speaker wires terminate. The front three run up
the wall to the ceiling while the back two disappear into the basement 
through the hole on the left. Ignore the big hole in the middle. Frank
had a muscle spasm. -grin-<br>
<img src=Mvc-018f.jpg>
<p>Here one of the rear speaker wire (bundles). Don't ask me why I stapled
it all up there -- it seemed a shame to trim it. The main power drop for the
rest of the house runs up the wall from the fuse box downstairs to the
rest of the house through the ceiling.<p>

In case you were wondering,
I used the 190' of wire that came with my new speakers, that's why the
wires are of irregular length and different consistencies.<br>
<img src=Mvc-020f.jpg>
<p> and here's where the rear speakers run though the basement. Isn't
that amazing how Frank drilled holes just like the professional
did for my other lines? Wow.<br>

<p>You can never have too much computer wiring. -grin- 
The new home of jays.net -- rack mounted in my utility room
 when I move in.

Frank, Eli and I did not do the plumbing...<br>

<p>They swept up!! It's starting to look less like a construction site!<br>

<p>Oooooooo!!!<p>
I'm <b>strongly</b> considering re-working this wall (in one of the
bedrooms), putting a big open-air thingy in there so it looks over the
great room and front door just like the top of the staircase. Would this
make a <i>great</i> computer room or what??!!<br>
