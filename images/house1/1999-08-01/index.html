<h1>J's Casa - 8-1-99</h1>

Curse. The diskette I took these with was bad, so only these photos
were salvaged. The garage concrete is all in, as is the basement concrete.
The framing is almost done (I assume) and as soon as the roof goes up
(1, 2, 3 weeks?) the electrical should start heralding the Jay's Casa Wiring
Extravaganza Weekend. Brace yourselves.<p>
