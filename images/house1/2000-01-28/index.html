<h1>J's Casa Jan. 28, 2000</h1>


Ever tried to hide 100 lbs. of pot on top of your pantry? I did, last night.
It looks pretty blah in these pictures but Sherrie & I saw it @ lunch
today and I couldn't resist. I got it up there all by myself. My life 
flashed before my eyes (twice) since the table is kinda floppy, and the
veins in my neck burst forth a wonderous spray of crimson victory, but
I did it.

Josh stopped by later to admire my handiwork and the general stupidity of
the groin pulling, back-throwing activity. J man! J lift heavy thingy! J grunt!

Eli smearing marmalade on my monitor. Notice the dumb terminal behind him --
direct jays.net console and web log monitor! I'm such a nerd...

My son, My son,
Let me be one of no doubt "dozens" to congratulate you on the creativity of
what shall be referred to in the annals of Hannah legend as the "pantry pot
project". First, the sheer igneous spontaneity of the discovery...see the
pot...hearing that voice in your head say, "got to have it!"...with not a
moment's "but how will I get it up there" or "this it crazy"...just the
lightning flash response, "I'll take it!! Put it in the truck!!" What
abandon!! What licentiousnes!!


And then, THEN amazed onlookers.....OH please assure me there were some
onlookers...the task of getting that sucker up there. Don't tell me that
semester as an engineering major was without it's benefit. What a feat of
left brain strategy and right brain "this just feels like the way" must
have been required to master that task. And Oh the sheer brawn of it...the
reckless hernia inviting manliness of it!

And now the great question...."Am I done?" Is this the full expression of
"potness"...the point of highest contribution of creative decor this work
has to offer? Perhaps $300 worth of plum grasses, silk flowers (only the
masculine ones), dried pods in three variety...a creation worthy of the
lobby of an Omni Hotel. That would be really cool and there certainly is
room..just what vaulted ceilings beg for. Or a live plant!!??. Lots of
light...room to grow...purifies the air...nice color splash. Shall I built
steps to water it? With a long watering tool, could I reach through the
holes in the staircase. ANd what about the weight of dirt? Would it crush
the cabinet...that would suck!


Oh the joys of home ownership!!   You're the greatest!!     Mom
