Reached Clint on his mobile phone. He says that there is no house wrap
anywhere on our house. He says that the house wrap requirement 
only became code on Oct 3 of this year. He said that we have a vapor
barrier -- it's the plastic outside the insulation on the inside of the house.
It stops moisture from getting in and ruining our drywall.

He said that lots of builders don't use house wrap (until now, since it's 
code now). For instance, Lifestyle homes never used to use it.
<p>
It's for inside breathing and to keep moisture out.

Fahey joined an International region council or something like that which
added 3 pages of code changes this month.

Note: I know for a fact we do not have plastic outside the insulation downstairs. I know this from chasing that mouse a few months ago. Maybe it doesn't need plastic downstairs because downstairs isn't finished yet? -Jay

I guess we should run this by Bill and see what he thinks?

Left voicemail on Clint's mobile phone (651-3982) and on his home 
phone (492-8492) telling him about the discovery of no house wrap 
and asking him to call my mobile phone.
