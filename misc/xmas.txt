Many high-fi versions of this are on the Internet. I stole from this one:

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely 
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it 
would look something like the following.

There would be:
57 Asians
21 Europeans
14 from the Western Hemisphere, both north and south
8 would be Africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white

70 would be non-Christian
30 would be Christian

89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual

6 people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 would 
be from the United States.

80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
(ONE)1 would be near death;
(ONE)1 would be near birth;
(ONE)1 (yes, only 1) would have a college education;
(ONE)1 (yes,only1) would own computer.

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the 
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly apparent.

And, therefore . . .

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof 
overhead and a place to sleep, you are richer than 75% of this world.

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness, you are 
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a 
dish someplace, you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment, arrest, 
torture, or death, you are more blessed than three billion people in 
the world.

If you have never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of 
imprisonment, the agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation, you are 
ahead of 500 million people in the world.

If your parents are still alive and still married, you are very rare, 
even in the United States.

If you can hold someone's hand, hug them, or even touch them on the 
shoulder, you are blessed because you can offer healing touch.

If you hold up your head with a smile on your face and are truly thankful, 
you are blessed because the majority can, but most do not.

If you can read this message, you have just received a double blessing in 
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed 
than over two billion people in the world who cannot read at all.
